  abstract = {In this paper, the performance loss rates of different technology crystalline silicon (c-Si) and thin-film photovoltaic (PV) systems were estimated and compared over their first eight years of operation at the test site of the Photovoltaic Technology Laboratory, University of Cyprus (UCY) in Nicosia, Cyprus, by applying different statistical trend analysis methods on monthly Performance Ratio, RP, time series. The statistical trend analysis methods include Linear Regression (LR), Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW) and LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) and were applied on monthly constructed time series of RP, calculated from the fifteen-minute average array DC power at the maximum power point, PA, of each grid-connected PV system. The comparison of the estimated performance loss rates for each technology showed that the average performance loss rate of the c-Si systems was 0.75 $\pm$ 0.17 \{\%\}/year. On the other hand, the average performance loss rate for the thin-film systems was 1.95 $\pm$ 0.11 \{\%\}/year for all methods, with a 95 \{\%\} confidence interval. The good agreement in the results between the different methods for each system also provided evidence that the performance loss rates have started to converge to a steady value. Finally, it was demonstrated that trend extraction techniques produced similar estimates between them and with very low uncertainty, even with less than five years of outdoor exposure, whereas LR was the least robust method for all technologies, since it was greatly affected by the seasonality and outliers of the time series and needed more years of data to produce reliable estimates.},

  doi = {10.1109/PVSC.2015.7355940},
  abstract = {This paper presents the results of an extensive testing campaign for validating the time series analysis approach to the estimation of the linear field performance loss rates (PLR) of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems of different technologies operating side-by-side at the PV Technology test site of the University of Cyprus since June 2006. Fifteen-minute average measurements of the array power at the maximum power point, PA, were used to construct time series of the performance ratio, RP, of each array. The time series were analysed with regARIMA and classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) in order to extract the trend. Then, linear regression (LR) was used to calculate the slope. To validate the results, all arrays were disassembled and every module was tested at Standard Test Conditions (STC) in a class A+A+A+ solar simulator, in order to calculate the nominal array degradation rate. Comparison of both methods has shown good agreement between the time series analysis approach and the indoor testing approach, for PV arrays with no identified failures through electroluminescence (EL). On the contrary, for modules with identified failures through EL, the nominal array degradation rate was higher in comparison to the field PLR. Differences between the two methods have been shown to be due to cracked cells, hotspots and spectral response mismatch. Lastly, the comparison has shown that amongst the time series analysis methods, regARIMA produced statistically significant PLR with low uncertainty and the best agreement with the nominal array degradation rates.},

  abstract = {In this work, the seasonality and performance loss rates of eleven grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems of different technologies were evaluated through seasonal adjustment. The classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) and X-12-ARIMA statistical techniques were applied on monthly DC performance ratio, RP, time series, constructed from field measurements over the systems' first five years of operation. The results have shown that the RP of crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies was higher during winter. This was also the case for the coppereindium gallium-diselenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) technologies but with lower seasonal amplitude. The amorphous silicon (a-Si) technology exhibited a different seasonal profile, with high RP during summer and autumn and low during winter. In addition, the trends extracted from the application of CSD and X-12-ARIMA on three-year, four-year and five-year RP time series were used to estimate linear performance loss rates. A comparison between standard linear regression (LR), CSD and X-12-ARIMA has shown that CSD and X-12-ARIMA resulted in higher rates overall for c-Si, 1.07 and 0.93\{\%\}/year respectively, but with significantly less uncertainty than LR. Lastly, it was shown that X-12-ARIMA provided statistical inference in the presence of outliers and produced model residuals that were uncorrelated, in contrast to CSD.},

Linear regression using LLS produced the lowest degradation rates overall, but when temperature correction was applied, the calculated degradation rates were increased by 0.4 \{\%\}/year. LLS also showed the lowest standard deviation for the thin-film PV systems, which was further reduced by applying temperature correction.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.155},
  abstract = {This paper provides a review of methodologies for measuring the degradation rate, RD, of photovoltaic (PV) technologies, as reported in the literature. As presented in this paper, each method yields different results with varying uncertainty depending on the measuring equipment, the data qualification and filtering criteria, the performance metric and the statistical method of estimation of the trend. This imposes the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true degradation rate and, subsequently, the effective lifetime of a PV module/array/system and proves the need for defining a standardized methodology. Through a literature search, four major statistical analysis methods were recognized for calculating degradation rates: (1) Linear Regression (LR), (2) Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), (3) AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and, (4) LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS), with LR being the most common. These analyses were applied on the following performance metrics: (1) electrical parameters from IV curves recorded under outdoor or simulated indoor conditions and corrected to STC, (2) regression models such as the Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications (PVUSA) and Sandia models, (3) normalized ratings such as Performance Ratio, RP, and PMPP/GI and, (4) scaled ratings such as PMPP/Pmax, PAC/Pmax and kWh/kWp. The degradation rate results have shown that the IV method produced the lowest RD and LR produced results with large variation and the largest uncertainty. The ARIMA and LOESS methods, albeit less popular, produced results with low variation and uncertainty and with good agreement between them. Most importantly, this review showed that the RD is not only technology and site dependent, but also methodology dependent.},

Robust PCA is used in order to remove the effects of uncertainty from the original PR time series. The data obtained after removing the effects of uncertainty is then used for computing a newly defined degradation rate measure, which is based on the area enclosed by the curves of the PR time series of the first and the last year of evaluation.

  title = {A Comprehensive Methodology for Outdoor and Indoor Degradation Studies on Photovoltaic Modules},
  abstract = {The scope of this paper is to present a methodology for evaluating the performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules installed outdoors on the plane of array (POA) and operating at maximum power point (MPP). The methodology is based on the installation of a 1 kWp, grid- connected photovoltaic system and 2 additional modules of the same make/model on the POA, with the additional modules connected to a computer controlled dc load. The dc load will keep each module operating at MPP, while performing I-V scans at regular intervals. This serves two purposes: a) the modules are operating and degrading as if they were connected to an inverter that keeps them at full load conditions and b) the I-V scans allow for the periodic measurement of the electrical characteristics of the PV modules, all essential in the study of their degradation. The additional modules will be periodically dismounted from the POA and put on a testbed, to acquire the STC (Standard Test Conditions) rating and the dark I-V characteristics, according to the IEC 60904-1 standard. The grid-connected system will serve as the basis for PV performance evaluation and degradation rate determination from a system standpoint. The paper will present important issues arising when comparing the outdoor and indoor measurements. These are: 1) the spectrum utilization, 2) how the time between when a module is dismounted from the POA and tested under the solar simulator can affect the internal stability of the module, 3) the I-V scanning sweep rate and, 4) the duration of the light pulses of the solar simulator and how the measured Pmax, with mismatch factor (MMF) corrections as described in standard IEC 60904-7, compares to the outdoor measurements of the PV technologies.},

  abstract = {Monolithic multi-junction solar cells are becoming prevalent in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems due to their high demonstrated conversion efficiencies. However, these devices often operate at sub-optimal levels due to current mismatch losses arising between each p-n junction as a result of natural variation in the solar spectrum at the earth's surface. The use of quantum wells in solar cell design affords improved control over the spectral response of the cells via band-gap engineering. This makes it possible to tailor the spectral response of a cell for optimum performance under a given annual spectral resource. Establishing the optimum spectral response for a given location is a major challenge of this approach to cell design, and relies heavily on averaged and modelled data based on combinations of satellite and sparse ground measurements. In addition, there is only limited field experience of such technology to date. The purpose of this work is to investigate through experiment the effect of incorporating multi-quantum-well (MQW) structures into photovoltaic cells to respond to a specific range of annual irradiation spectra and to compare the results obtained with those predicted through modelling. A number of triple-junction cells of different design have been placed side-by-side on an accurate solar tracker, and current-voltage characteristics of each taken at regular intervals over a few months. The outputs are then compared to those predicted by a model of cell performance that includes simulated spectra, generated with the SMARTS program, specific to that location and period of time. Results obtained from outdoor testing indicate that the cells designed to provide improved current matching under the spectral conditions in which they have been tested have performed more consistently than conventional cell designs. This is evident when the short-circuit current is normalised to a fixed direct normal irradiation and temperature, and plotted against atmospheric depth. Detailed analysis of the spectral resource is expected to reveal additional information on the performance of the cells.},

  abstract = {In this work, the performance loss rates of eleven grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems of different technologies were evaluated by applying linear regression (LR) and trend extraction methods to Performance Ratio, RP, time series. In particular, model-based methods such as Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), as well as non-parametric filtering methods such as LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) were used to extract the trend from monthly RP time series of the first five years of operation of each PV system. The results showed that applying LR on the time series produced the lowest performance loss rates for most systems, but with significant autocorrelations in the residuals, signifying statistical inaccuracy. The application of CSD and HW significantly reduced the residual autocorrelations as the seasonal component was extracted from the time series, resulting in comparable results for eight out of eleven PV systems, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.22 \{\%\} between the performance loss rates calculated from each method. Finally, the optimal use of multiplicative ARIMA resulted in Gaussian white noise (GWN) residuals and the most accurate statistical model of the RP time series. ARIMA produced higher performance loss rates than LR for all technologies, except the amorphous Silicon (a-Si) system. The LOESS non-parametric method produced directly comparable results to multiplicative ARIMA, with a MAPE of -2.04 \{\%\} between the performance loss rates calculated from each method, whereas LR, CSD and HW showed higher deviation from ARIMA, with MAPE of 25.14 \{\%\}, -13.71 \{\%\} and -6.39 \{\%\}, respectively.},

  abstract = {In this work, outdoor and indoor measurements from a double junction amorphous Silicon (a-Si) photovoltaic (PV) module installed at the PV Technology outdoor test site of the University of Cyprus were used to assess the field performance from November 2012 to June 2015. The measurements consisted of continuous current- voltage (I-V) curves from outdoor testing and bi-weekly indoor ratings at standard test conditions (STC) in a solar simulator. In order to accurately evaluate the field performance under varying meteorological conditions, the electrical parameters were extracted from field I-V curves and were then filtered for high irradiance and low angles of incidence, extrapolated to 1000 W/m2 irradiance and corrected for temperature losses. Additionally, the outdoor I-V curves were used to calculate Loss Factor Model (LFM-B) parameters. A comparison of the indoor ratings at STC to each of the two field performance indicators has shown that there was very good agreement with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.9 \{\%\} and 4.47 \{\%\} when using the filtered and corrected PMPP and the LFM-B Performance Factor (PF), respectively. Lastly, the effects of the module's metastable behavior on the performance were analyzed from indoor measurements at STC. It has been shown that the module suffered a degradation rate of 2.36 \{\%\}/year, while the Staebler-Wronski effect and thermal annealing resulted in $\pm$3 \{\%\} variation of the performance, observable throughout the year.},

  abstract = {With the current uptake and market penetration of different technology photovoltaics (PV), important questions arise regarding their lifetime power decline and degradation. Another important consideration is the influence of different climatic conditions on the exhibited degradation rates, with warmer operating conditions theoretically affecting module components to a higher extent compared to lower temperatures. The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of the annual performance loss rates of different photovoltaic (PV) systems, ranging from mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si) to multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si) and thin-film technologies, installed in Cyprus over a period of five years. The results of the performance loss rate investigation showed that the mono-c-Si and multi-c-Si systems exhibited average annual performance loss rates that were lower than the 1 \{\%\}/year stated by most PV module manufactures. Conversely, the average annual performance loss rate of the thin-film systems was -1.78 \{\%\}/year.},

  abstract = {The power produced from solar systems depends strongly on the prevailing weather conditions and more precisely on solar irradiance. Due to the dependence of such systems on the weather conditions the electricity injected into the grid is intermittent in nature with potentially negative impact on the grid operation. The quality and quantity of the electrical power produced from solar systems is directly related to the available solar irradiance and therefore any disturbances to the latter affect the produced power. In this paper, the characterisation and classification of the daily solar irradiance from 12 locations in mainland USA is presented based on 4 years of ground measurements. The K-POP method used evaluates the quantity and quality of solar irradiance for a day and as a consequence classifies the day based on these two indices. The statistical analysis of the results shows high correlation through the years for each station. This is a strong indication that the sky conditions are predictable and that with the utilisation of mechanisms, such as storage, spinning reserve, etc. solar systems can become a major contributor to the energy mix. Finally, this analysis provides better insight into the solar resource of a given location.},

  abstract = {Grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems have become a significant constituent of the power supply mix. A challenge faced by both users and suppliers of PV systems is that of defining and computing a reliable metric of annual degradation rate while in service. This paper defines a new measure to calculate the degradation rate of PV systems from the PV field measured performance ratio (PR). At first, the PR time series is processed by conventional principal component analysis, which yields seasonality as the dominant data feature. The environment, operating conditions, uncertainty, and hardware used for monitoring influence the outdoor measurements unpredictably. These influences are viewed as perturbations that render the dominant feature obtained by PCA unsuitable to be used in a degradation rate definition. Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is proposed to alleviate these effects. The new measure is defined as the area enclosed by the time series of the corrected by the RPCA annual monthly PR values. The degradation rates obtained for different technologies are compared with those obtained in previous studies. The results have shown that the degradation rates estimated by RPCA were in good agreement with previous investigations and provided increased confidence due to mitigation of uncertainty.},

Measurements from mono-crystalline (mono-c-Si), multi-crystalline (multi-c-Si) and amorphous (a-Si) silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) systems were used to construct monthly dc performance ratio (PR) time-series, from outdoor measurements. Each PR time-series was modeled a) with multiplicative ARIMA, b) with linear regression and c) with Seasonal-Trend Decomposition by Loess (STL) using the first 4 years of each time-series in order to compare the accuracy of the different methods. The models were used to forecast the PR of the 5th year of the different PV technologies and the results from the aforementioned statistical methods were compared based on the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results showed that ARIMA produced the lowest RMSE for crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies, whereas for thin-film technologies, STL was more accurate. The results from ARIMA also showed that thin-film technologies were optimally modeled with identical model orders, whereas for c-Si, each technology required a different optimal model order.},

  abstract = {Mathematical and empirical models have long been used to describe the output behaviour of photovoltaic (PV) systems. The purpose of this paper is to compare the combined uncertainties inherent in the results when using three of these models; the single-point efficiency, the single-point efficiency with temperature correction and the PVUSA model. This evaluation was performed using outdoor measurement data from 12 different grid- connected PV systems of 1 kWp each, operating in Cyprus since June 2006 along with measurement data from the meteorological sensor network on-site. The models showed a wide variation in combined uncertainties, demonstrating the dependence of accurate energy yield predictions on the model and sensing equipment. In particular, it was shown that the application of temperature correction on the single-point efficiency model using the manufacturer provided temperature coefficients (\$$\backslash$gamma\$MPP) resulted in a reduction of the combined uncertainty. In the case of the single-point efficiency model, the uncertainties were in the name-plate efficiency at standard test conditions (\$$\backslash$eta\$STC) and the global irradiation measured on the plane of array (GPOA), producing a combined uncertainty of $\pm$7\{\%\} on the annual dc energy yield of all PV systems. By applying temperature correction on the model, the combined uncertainties dropped to an average of $\pm$5.60\{\%\}, despite the introduction of additional uncertainties from \$$\backslash$gamma\$MPP and Tmodule. Lastly, the PVUSA model showed even lower combined uncertainties, in the realm of $\pm$1.60\{\%\}. The paper also presents the combined uncertainties inherent in the three models separately for four different years (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010).},

The arrays under study have been operating side-by-side since June 2006 in Nicosia, Cyprus. Fifteen-minute average field measurements over their first ten years of operation were used to create a data set, in which invalid measurements were removed and logged system downtimes were corrected based on past performance. The resulting data set was randomly sampled to select data points which were designated as Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) in order to create unbiased artificial outage periods. The same data set was treated with missing data imputation techniques such as imputation by the mean, linear interpolation and imputation by bootstrap. The resulting data sets were then analysed with linear regression (LR), classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) and regARIMA models to extract the trend and estimate the energy degradation rates. The results have shown that regARIMA was the most robust method for up to 10 \% of missing data, the LR and CSD methods were sensitive starting from 2 \% of missing data and that imputation by the bootstrap enhanced the accuracy of the estimated degradation rates up to 20 \% for regARIMA and 40 \% for LR.},
