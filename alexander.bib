  abstract = {In this paper the theory of mismatch factor of the terrestrial solar spectrum is extended to more accurately represent the irradiance available to specific types of photovoltaic (PV) materials from surface albedo. Using spectra derived from the SBDART radiative transfer model, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based PV technology compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. In order to quantify this effect for varying representative spectra, spectra for cloud optical thicknesses from 0 to 150 were investigated. Grass was found to be a poor reflector in the a-Si:H spectral response range with a spectrally responsive albedo of 0.08-0.07 as cloud optical thickness increased from 0 to 150, whereas snow is a good reflector with a relatively constant spectrally responsive albedo of 0.94 as cloud optical thickness increased from 0 to 150. For c-Si PV systems the spectrally responsive albedo for snow and grass were found to be 0.87-0.91 and 0.24-0.15 as cloud optical thickness increased from 0 to 150, respectively. These values can be compared to the albedo typically predicted from spectral integration relative to an AM1.5 spectrum of 0.78 for snow and 0.23 for grass. On a yearly basis, the use of improper albedo values can lead to an under-prediction of system yields of 0.04\{\%\}, 2.4\{\%\}, and 10.5\{\%\} for systems at 25°, 40°, and 90° tilt from the horizontal, respectively. This can lead to improper PV systems optimization and masking of other loss mechanisms. The results of this study have implications for both solar systems evaluation and systems design, and supports further research on tailoring PV technologies specifically to the climate and geographic location where they are deployed. \{©\} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This detection goal is very challenging due to the presence of various types of image anomalies like dislocation clusters, grain boundaries, and other artifacts due to the spurious discontinuities in the gray levels. In this work, an algorithm featuring an improved anisotropic diffusion filter and advanced image segmentation technique is proposed. The methods and procedures are assessed using 600 electroluminescence images, comprising 313 intact and 287 defected samples. Results indicate that the methods and procedures can accurately detect micro-crack in solar cells with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy averaging at 97\%, 80\%, and 88\%, respectively.},

The aim of this work is thus to carry out a performance comparison of three different and representative PV technologies in temperate climatic conditions; in particular, the influence of climatic parameters on energy production was investigated, with a focus on the thermal and spectral analysis. The experimental results, referred to a monitoring period of one year, show a significant difference between the reference performances, rated under standard test conditions, and the actual daily/seasonal productivity, providing useful information about the different interaction with climate of the technologies tested. \{©\} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Latest trends in the photovoltaic sector see the use of innovative photovoltaic technologies with extended spectral responsivity ranging from 300 to 1200\,nm for non-concentrating terrestrial applications, and to 1800\,nm for concentrating PV and space applications. As a consequence, an update of the IEC 60904-9 standard is ongoing with a definition of new spectral ranges for the assessment of the spectral match. This poses new challenges to laboratories and research centers on whether or not they still are able to accurately measure the spectral mismatch of their sun simulator in the newly-defined spectral regions. Prior to that, there is a need to understand if the commercially available spectroradiometers are ready to extend their measurement range as prescribed by the forthcoming new standard. This paper analyses two options for an extension of the spectrum characterisation of solar simulators to 300–1200\,nm and compares them in terms of spectral match of global normal irradiance (GNI) spectra acquired under natural sunlight by eight spectroradiometers during the 6th European Spectroradiometer Intercomparison. The acquired spectra are also compared in terms of an index of consistency of the spread of the measured spectra with the estimated measurement uncertainty, hereafter named as performance statisticsEn. Results show that all investigated laboratories assure the equivalence of the spectral match classification well below the 25\% limit corresponding to class-A simulators. When considering the more stringent class-A+ corresponding to a 12.5\% limit, one of the two considered options that rearranges the 300–1200\,nm spectral range into 6 bands appears to still assure the equivalence of the class A+ limits among considered instruments. The En performance index analysis highlights some inconsistencies with the estimated measurement uncertainty or instrument drifts from the expected performance, and the need of further improvements in calibration, set up and measurement procedures.},

This poses new challenges in the correct measurement of the spectral content of solar simulators and natural sunlight in those wavelength bands that lie outside these limits. This study proposes an extension of the IEC 60904-9 bandwidth by adding two bands in the UV (300-400 nm) and NIR (1100-1200 nm) regions. This new proposed extension is analysed in terms of spectral match, using spectral measurements of Global Normal Irradiance (GNI) acquired during the 6th European Spectroradiometer Intercomparison by eight independent laboratories. A laboratory is selected to provide reference spectra, and the spectral match of the other ones is calculated, both on a single-measurement level and on a daily average level. The intra-day and inter-day variations are evaluated as well. Results show that all investigated laboratories are capable to assure a spectral match well below the ±25\% limit corresponding to class-A simulators. When the more stringent, informal class-A+ corresponding to the ±12.5\% limit is considered, four out of seven laboratories are still compliant with it.},

This work presents an improved estimation method to decrease the uncertainty associated to PLR assessment by (a) using the array generated power metric corrected to Standard Test Conditions (STC), namely P\{\textbackslash textless\}inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}max,STC\{\textbackslash textless\}/inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}, to minimize seasonal oscillations, (b) applying a filtering technique to eliminate outliers and (c) performing linear interpolation on P\{\textbackslash textless\}inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}max,STC\{\textbackslash textless\}/inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\} monthly averages series. Estimated PLR and its uncertainty are assessed using three-years data from twenty-four grid-connected PV arrays representing nine different PV technologies and results are compared with two other widely-recognized performance metrics, namely: the Array Performance Ratio (PR\{\textbackslash textless\}inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}a\{\textbackslash textless\}/inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}) and the Array Photovoltaic for Utility Systems Applications (PVUSA\{\textbackslash textless\}inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}a\{\textbackslash textless\}/inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}). Results show (a) that adding spectral correction to irradiance and temperature correction reduces the uncertainty of 25\{\%\} on average and (b) that the uncertainty associated to P\{\textbackslash textless\}inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\}max,STC\{\textbackslash textless\}/inf\{\textbackslash textgreater\} metric is reduced to more than 60\{\%\} on average with respect to the other investigated metrics for crystalline silicon-based technologies, while it is comparable in the case of thin-film technologies. Finally, two procedures estimating the first year PLR and the the first five months PLR are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {A Pascal program, PVNet, has been developed at the Commission of the European Communities Joint Research Centre, Ispra, to model the electrical behaviour of solar cell interconnection circuits. The program calculates three-quadrant solar cell current-voltage (I–V) curves using a lumped parameter equivalent circuit model, combines them to obtain the resultant I–V curve of any interconnection circuit, and calculates the operating point of each circuit element, set by user-defined operating conditions. The numerical values of the equivalent circuit parameters are generated by the program, and are varied so that the electrical parameters (short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor) of calculated I–V curves show the same variations as those of measured crystalline silicon solar cell I–V curves. Equivalent circuit parameters can be changed by the user, making it possible to simulate the effects of electrical mismatches on the performance of an interconnection circuit. To illustrate the operation of the program, the electrical mechanisms leading to hot-spot heating in photovoltaic arrays are analysed. Three types of interconnection circuit are considered: a simple series string, a series-parallel block and a series connection of series-parallel blocks. The operation of parallel bypass diodes (used to limit hot-spot heating in series strings) and of series blocking diodes (used to prevent current imbalance in series-parallel circuits) are explained.},

First, multiple (≈ 5) completed copies of the data set are created where cells measured without error are held constant, those missing are imputed from the distribution of predicted values, and cells (or entire variables) with measurement error are “overimputed,” that is imputed from the predictive distribution with observation-level priors defined by the mismeasured values and available external information, if any.

This method is based on the calculation of sets of parameters of a PV module in different operating conditions, by means of a Neuro-Fuzzy approach. The PV system status is determined by evaluation and comparison of norms based on the aforementioned parameters, with threshold values. This intelligent system developed in Matlab \{\&\} Simulink environment, consists on the study of the crucial information that the six parameters in normal and faulty condition contain. They are calculated using the I-V curves and synthesized by "hybrid" models. Results show that the diagnosis system is able to discern between normal and faulty operation conditions and with the same defective existence of noise and disturbances.},

With the advent of power system monitoring and communication technology collectively known as the "smart grid," an opportunity exists to apply signal processing techniques to monitoring and control of PV arrays. In this paper a monitoring system which provides real-time measurements of each PV module's voltage and current is considered. A fault detection algorithm formulated as a clustering problem and addressed using the robust minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimator is described; its performance on simulated instances of arc and ground faults is evaluated. The algorithm is found to perform well on many types of faults commonly occurring in PV arrays. 2012 IEEE.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical communityhas been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commit- ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob- lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theoryand practice, has developed rapidlyin fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move awayfrom exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

This study explores how this mismatch loss depends on variations in max-power current and max-power voltage from cell to cell. An analysis of a series string is first performed. Losses in a parallel string are also determined. Estimates of mismatch losses in more complex arrays are then obtained. In addition to generally excellent comparison with several numerical studies, results show that, for a series string, there exists a critical magnitude of deviation in cell max-power current beyond which the power loss due to mismatch is sensitive to both the number of cells placed in series and the shape of the probability density function defining variations in max-power current. This critical level also depends on the cell fill-factor.},

Module maximum output power averaged 14\{\%\} below the nameplate rating and exhibited a coefficient of variation of 2.1\{\%\}. Mismatch losses were very small, never exceeding 0.53\{\%\}.

  abstract = {We extend the principal component analysis (PCA) to second-order stationary vector time series in the sense that we seek for a contemporaneous linear transformation for a \$p\$-variate time series such that the transformed series is segmented into several lower-dimensional subseries, and those subseries are uncorrelated with each other both contemporaneously and serially. Therefore those lower-dimensional series can be analyzed separately as far as the linear dynamic structure is concerned. Technically it boils down to an eigenanalysis for a positive definite matrix. When \$p\$ is large, an additional step is required to perform a permutation in terms of either maximum cross-correlations or FDR based on multiple tests. The asymptotic theory is established for both fixed \$p\$ and diverging \$p\$ when the sample size \$n\$ tends to infinity. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real datasets indicate that the proposed method is an effective initial step in analysing multiple time series data, which leads to substantial dimension reduction in modelling and forecasting high-dimensional linear dynamical structures. Unlike PCA for independent data, there is no guarantee that the required linear transformation exists. When it does not, the proposed method provides an approximate segmentation which leads to the advantages in, for example, forecasting for future values. The method can also be adapted to segment multiple volatility processes.},

Electrical field measurements data are used to evaluate the PV panel parameters once and for all. A mathematical model describing the variations of the maximum power versus solar irradiance level and temperature was obtained with the Design of Experiments method. This model is a predictive model. It assesses the value of the maximum power delivered anywhere in the experimental domain. Given a known solar irradiance level and temperature, any discrepancy between the calculated and measured maximum power values signals any dysfunctional operation so that appropriate action can be taken such as maintenance or repair. A complete analysis of the measurements is performed to optimize the method. Firstly, the basic elements of the Design of Experiments method are presented. Three models are then considered: the non-standard model with four trials, the non-standard model with 11 trials, and finally a model with 4 points recalculated to be placed at the vertices of the study area. A practical method of implementation is then proposed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A challenging problem exists in the estimation of missing space-time data where the time series are relatively short, and the space series belong to a spatial hierarchy. An example is provided by the population estimates for regions belonging to the NUTS hierarchy which are available from the EUROSTAT data portal. The table demo\_r\_gind3 provides estimates of the population of NUTS0/1/2/3 regions at the 1st January 2000…2012 inclusive. Inspection of the table reveals that estimates are missing for 2000-2003 for two of the five NUTS3 regions in the NUTS2 region of Liège. There are other instances of missing data at NUTS3 where there are data for the corresponding higher level NUTS regions. The EUROSTAT table demo\_r\_d2jan provides estimates of the population on the 1st January for a longer time period, 1990…2012 inclusive, but these are only to NUTS2. Again, there is missing data. The question then arises as to whether it is possible to estimate the missing series. The NUTS2 values act as a constraint on the NUTS3 values – the total population of the NUTS3 regions should equal those of the corresponding NUTS2 regions. However, the relative shortness of the available series is a challenge if conventional methods of time series analysis are adopted. Furthermore, the imposition of the spatial constraints is both a check as well as a challenge.},

  abstract = {This paper takes a broad, pragmatic view of statistical inference to include all aspects of model formulation. The estimation of model parameters traditionally assumes that a model has a prespecified known form and takes no account of possible uncertainty regarding the model structure. This implicitly assumes the existence of a `true' model, which many would regard as a fiction. In practice model uncertainty is a fact of life and likely to be more serious than other sources of uncertainty which have received far more attention from statisticians. This is true whether the model is specified on subject-matter grounds or, as is increasingly the case, when a model is formulated, fitted and checked on the same data set in an iterative, interactive way. Modern computing power allows a large number of models to be considered and data-dependent specification searches have become the norm in many areas of statistics. The term data mining may be used in this context when the analyst goes to great lengths to obtain a good fit. This paper reviews the effects of model uncertainty, such as too narrow prediction intervals, and the non-trivial biases in parameter estimates which can follow data-based modelling. Ways of assessing and overcoming the effects of model uncertainty are discussed, including the use of simulation and resampling methods, a Bayesian model averaging approach and collecting additional data wherever possible. Perhaps the main aim of the paper is to ensure that statisticians are aware of the problems and start addressing the issues even if there is no simple, general theoretical fix.},

The proposed method generates a diagnostic signal which indicates possible faults occurring in the GCPV plant. In order to determine the location of the fault, the ratio between DC and AC power is monitored. The software tool developed identifies different types of faults like: fault in a photovoltaic module, fault in a photovoltaic string, fault in an inverter, and a general fault that may include partial shading, PV ageing, or MPPT error. In addition to the diagnostic signal, other essential information about the system can be displayed each 10min on the designed tool. The method has been validated using an experimental database of climatic and electrical parameters regarding a 20kWp GCPV plant installed on the rooftop of the municipality of Trieste, Italy. The obtained results indicate that the proposed method can detect and locate correctly different type of faults in both DC and AC sides of the GCPV plant. The developed software can help users to check possible faults on their systems in real time. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This automatic supervision system has been developed in Matlab\{\&\}Simulink environment. It includes parameter extraction techniques to calculate main PV system parameters from monitoring data in real conditions of work, taking into account the environmental irradiance and module temperature evolution, allowing simulation of the PV system behaviour in real time. The automatic supervision method analyses the output power losses, presents in the DC side of the PV generator, capture losses. Two new power losses indicators are defined: thermal capture losses (Lct) and miscellaneous capture losses (Lcm). The processing of these indicators allows the supervision system to generate a faulty signal as indicator of fault detection in the PV system operation. Two new indicators of the deviation of the DC variables respect to the simulated ones have been also defined. These indicators are the current and voltage ratios: RC and RV. Analysing both, the faulty signal and the current/voltage ratios, the type of fault can be identified. The automatic supervision system has been successfully tested experimentally. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results in this paper provide the information necessary to identify a suitable energy tool for analysing the integration of renewable energy into various energy-systems under different objectives. It is evident from this paper that there is no energy tool that addresses all issues related to integrating renewable energy, but instead the 'ideal' energy tool is highly dependent on the specific objectives that must be fulfilled. The typical applications for the 37 tools reviewed (from analysing single-building systems to national energy-systems), combined with numerous other factors such as the energy-sectors considered, technologies accounted for, time parameters used, tool availability, and previous studies, will alter the perception of the 'ideal' energy tool. In conclusion, this paper provides the information necessary to direct the decision-maker towards a suitable energy tool for an analysis that must be completed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In this paper we provide an overview of some trend models formulated for global and local estimation. Global trend models are based on the assumption that the trend or nonstationary mean of a time series can be approximated closely by simple functions of time over the entire span of the series. The most common representation of deterministic and stochastic trend are introduced. In particular, for the former we analyze polynomial and transcendental functions, whereas for the latter we assume that the series from which the trend will be identified follows a homogeneous linear nonstationary stochastic process. Recently more attention has been oriented on the analysis of the short term trend, that includes cyclical fluctuations and is referred to as trend-cycle. At this regard, we analyze the local polynomial regression predictors developed by Henderson (1916) and LOESS due to Cleveland (1979), which are the most widely applied to estimate the short term local trend of seasonally adjusted economic indicators.},

Calibrated PSPICE simulations are employed to illustrate the method and test its reliability.

  abstract = {Regional forecasts of power generated by photovoltaic systems have an important role helping power utilities to manage grids with a high level of penetration of such systems. The objective of this study is to propose a method to obtain one-day ahead hourly regional forecasts of photovoltaic power when regional information is available. The method is based on the use of principal component analysis, support vector regression and weather forecast data. One-day ahead regional forecasts of photovoltaic power were done for 4 of the main regions of Japan for 1 year, 2009, using hourly power generation data of 453 photovoltaic systems. The performance of the method was characterized comparing the results it yielded with the ones provides by a persistence approach and by an approach that do not employ the principal component analysis. Moreover, the expected smoothing effect on the error achieved when the regional forecasts are based on forecasts for each photovoltaic system is presented, constituting an additional reference to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the method performed well; its regional forecasts had a normalized annual root mean square error of 0.07kWh/kWrated in the worst case, and the persistence approach was outperformed by at least 51\{\%\} regarding the same error. The use of principal component proved to be a simple and particularly effective approach, decreasing the bias of the forecasts in all regions, and causing a reduction of the normalized root mean square error from 20.2\{\%\} to 57.8\{\%\} depending on the region. The proposed method also yielded results within the same level of forecasts which benefitted from the smoothing effect; the former presented a maximum variation of 10.2\{\%\} of the normalized root mean square error of the latter in the worst case. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

These experiments evaluated a procedure to stabilize the measured performance of thin-film polycrystalline cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of CdTe and CIGS thin-film PV devices and modules exhibit transitory changes in electrical performance after thermal exposure in the dark and/or bias and light exposures. We present the results of our case studies of module performance versus exposure: light soaked at 65 degrees C; exposed in the dark under forward bias at 65 degrees C; and, finally, longer-term outdoor exposure. We find that stabilization can be achieved to varying degrees using either light-soaking or dark-bias methods and that the existing IEC 61646 light-soaking interval may be appropriate for CdTe and CIGS modules with one caveat: it is likely that at least three exposure intervals are required for stabilization.

  abstract = {This paper presents recent progress in reducing the measurement uncertainty for crystalline silicon (c-Si) and thin-film PV modules. It describes the measurement procedure and the uncertainty analysis, as applied at the CalLab PV Modules, Fraunhofer ISE's laboratory for module measurements. The uncertainty analysis covers the complete calibration process in detail, including measurements, correction to standard testing conditions, and determination of electrical module parameters (I-SC, P-MPP, V-OC, etc.) from the I-V curve. Differences between c-Si and thin-film modules are addressed, most importantly in terms of spectral mismatch factor and short timescale stability problems. The paper outlines the importance of a comprehensive quality assurance system in a calibration laboratory as a prerequisite for accurate measurements on a daily basis. Particular attention is paid to results from a series of measurements taken every three weeks over a three-year period and conducted as part of the quality assurance system. In conclusion, this paper introduces a best-case uncertainty for c-Si module calibration of 1.6\{\%\} for P-MPP and 1.3\{\%\} for I-SC. This represents the lowest reported uncertainty for full size module calibration in a laboratory so far. The presented uncertainty in PMPP of cadmium telluride and single-junction amorphous silicon modules is 2.9\{\%\} and 1.8\{\%\}, respectively. All mentioned uncertainties are expanded uncertainties (k = 2).},

  abstract = {DNV GL has reviewed literature reports on observed rates of degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules and systems, and the reported data were filtered for applicability and relevance to current PV systems. The data were also reviewed for the quality of the measurement method to better account for uncertainty and to attempt to narrow the large range of reported degradation rates for crystalline silicon PV technologies. The results were statistically aggregated to calculate the module and system level degradation rates. This analysis yielded a mean module level degradation rate of -0.57\{\%\}/year with a P80 confidence interval of -0.10 to -1.06\{\%\}/year and a median system-level degradation rate of 0.77\{\%\}/year (P80 confidence interval of -0.05 to -1.45\{\%\}/year). This suggests that an additional 0.20\{\%\}/year beyond the module degradation rate may be attributed to a combination of system-level degradation impacts and measurement uncertainties. Based on this study DNV GL has concluded that the long-term system degradation rate of 0.75\{\%\}/year that we have assumed in the past is supported by the literature. We recognize that performance of specific products may represent narrow subsets within the range of published results, but the limited availability of product-identified results currently makes it difficult to justify estimating product-specific long-term degradation. This paper describes relevant concerns in evaluating degradation estimates and shows how results from over 2000 published instances of degradation results were reviewed to reach this finding.},

  abstract = {Information-centric networking (ICN) has long been advocating for radical changes to the Internet, but the upgrade challenges that these entail have hindered its adoption. To break this loop, the POINT project proposed a hybrid, IP-over-ICN, architecture: IP networks are preserved at the edge, connected to each other over an ICN core. This exploits the key benefits of ICN, enabling individual network operators to improve the performance of their IP-based services, without changing the rest of the Internet. This paper first provides an overview of POINT and outlines how it can improve upon IP in terms of performance and resilience. It then describes a trial of the POINT prototype in a production network, where real users operated actual IP-based applications. As part of the trial, we carried out experiments to evaluate the quality of experience (QoE) for video services offered via either HLS or IPTV, using either IP or POINT as a substrate. The results from the trial verify that the IP-over-ICN approach of POINT offers enhanced QoE to the users of these video services, compared with traditional IP, especially under exceptional network conditions.},

  abstract = {Small grid-connected photovoltaic systems up to 5 kWp are often not monitored because advanced surveillance systems are not economical. Hence, some system failures which lead to partial energy losses stay unnoticed for a long time. Even a failure that results in a larger energy deficit can be difficult to detect by PV laymen due to the fluctuating energy yields. Within the EU project PVSAT-2, a fully automated performance check has been developed to assure maximum energy yields and to optimize system maintenance for small grid-connected PV systems. The aim is the early detection of system malfunctions and changing operating conditions to prevent energy and subsequent financial losses for the operator. The developed procedure is based on satellite-derived solar irradiance information that replaces on-site measurements. In conjunction with a simulation model the expected energy yield of a PV system is calculated. In case of the occurrence of a defined difference between the simulated and actual energy yield, an automated failure detection routine searches for the most probable failure sources and notifies the operator. This paper describes the individual components of the developed procedure-the satellite-derived irradiance, the used PV simulation model, and the principles of the automated failure detection routine. Moreover, it presents results of an 8-months test phase with 100 PV systems in three European countries. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We use a Monte Carlo framework to explore the sensitivity of PV investment returns to three categories of PV investment uncertainty: 1) interannual solar variability, 2) PV technical performance and maintenance costs, and 3) market risks including future electricity rates and the possibility that retail electricity rates will be restructured for PV customers. We find that PV investment risk and uncertainty is driven by market factors in some U. S. regions (California and Massachusetts) and by the PV technical performance in other U. S. regions (Missouri and Florida). We explore the relative impacts of three methods for reducing PV investment uncertainty: research-and-development-driven performance improvements, system performance guarantees that are common for third-party owned systems, and long-term power purchase contracts. We find that the effectiveness of each risk reduction option varies by region, depending on which factors drive regional PV investment uncertainty.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of 40 silicon-based photovoltaic solar modules origi- nating from six different manufactures which were tested and characterised origin- ally at the European Solar Test Installation, (ESTI), in the period 1982–1984. These same modules have been re-measured in 2004 after 20–22 years of continuous out- door weathering. These modules are a subset ‘Rack C' of the JRC Ispra outdoor test field where examples of diverse generations of PV technologies have been subjected to long-term climatic exposure. We have compared the results obtained from these samples with the typical guarantees which are given by module manufacturers and we can see that in general the manufacturers are conservative with their power guar- antees. Most modules exceed the minimum power levels given for 10 years exposure, even after 22 years in the field. The results presented in this paper indicate that the degradation observed in the field is comparable to that observed in Type Approval Testing. This result not only validates the testing and stress levels applied in the Type Approval Tests, but also would indicate that (with the majority of modules exceeding the level of 92\{\%\} of Pmax after 20 years) the actual lifetime of these products is sig- nificantly more than 20 years.},

Specifically, it is a cornerstone algorithm for data analysis, dimensionality reduction and data compression. However, despite modern computer power, massive datasets pose a computational challenge for traditional SVD algorithms. We present the R package rsvd, which enables the fast computation of the SVD and related methods, facilitated by randomized algorithms. The rsvd package provides routines for computing the randomized singular value decomposition, randomized principal component analysis and randomized robust principal component analysis. Randomized algorithms provide an efficient computational framework for reducing the computational demands of traditional (deterministic) matrix factorizations. The key idea is to compute a compressed representation of the data using random sampling. This smaller (compressed) matrix captures the essential information that can then be used to obtain a low-rank matrix approximation. Several numerical examples demonstrate the usage of the rsvd package. The results show substantial accelerated computational times using the powerful concept of randomization.},

In this paper, the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) method is used to classify the PDs. After the algorithm has been trained it uses the input vector, which contains the features that would be used for classification, to calculate the probability density function (pdf) of each class and together with the assignment of a cost for a misclassification the decision that minimizes the expected risk is taken. The maximum likelihood training is employed here. The success of this particular method for classification is asserted. This method has the advantage over Multilayer Neural Network that it gives rapid training speed, guaranteed convergence to a Bayes classifier if enough training examples are provided (i.e. it approaches Bayes optimality), incremental training which is fast (i.e. additionally provided training examples can be incorporated without difficulties) and robustness to noisy examples. The results obtained here (99.3\{\%\}, 84.3\{\%\} and 85.5\{\%\} for the corona, the floating in oil and the internal discharges respectively) are very encouraging for the use of PNN in PD classification. \{©\}2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The identification of partial discharges in high voltage equipment has emerged as one of the most effective condition monitoring methods for assessing the integrity of the equipment under test. The fact that the application of PD monitoring methods is being applied online makes the measurements suffer from noise, inevitable at the measurement point, and reduces the sensitivity of the measurements. Signal processing methods to post process the measurements have been utilised, resulting not only in rejection of the noise and improvement of the sensitivity, but also in improved classification of the PD. A powerful noise rejection technique, the wavelet packets transform (WPT) has been extensively employed for the effective extraction of PD signals from noise. This technique is particularly useful in denoising signals which have transient characteristics. It expands the signal into different bases that are chosen adaptively according to a cost function, transforming the signal into a set of wavelet coefficients. The choice of a cost function has a significant effect on the compact representation of the signal. In this paper after the theory of wavelet packets is first briefly presented, and the denoising performance of the various wavelet packets parameters, such as the wavelet function, the thresholding type, and the cost function to be used is studied through the use of data acquired in a laboratory experimental environment for four types of discharges; namely the corona discharge in air, the internal discharge in oil, the floating discharge in oil and the surface discharge in air. The Symmlet wavelet has been compared with the Daubechies wavelet, both with 8 vanishing moments, the hard thresholding rule has been compared with the soft thresholding rule, and three cost functions have been compared as to their suitability for best basis expansion. Using some predefined criteria to assess their denoising performance the Symmlet 8 has been found to outperform the Daubech- - ies 8 wavelet, the hard thresholding rule to yield better performance than the soft thresholding rule and the Shannon entropy cost function to perform better that the log energy and the norm energy cost functions.

  abstract = {Partial discharge (PD) classification in power cable accessories and high voltage equipment in general is essential in evaluating the severity of the damage in the insulation. In this article, the PD classification was realised as a two-fold process. Firstly, measurements taken from a high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) sensor were represented as features by means of a transformation to the classifier and secondly, the probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier itself was capable of effectively recognising features coming from different types of discharges. The feature that was used as a fingerprint for PD characterisation was extracted from the moments of the probability density function (PDF) of the wavelet coefficients at various scales, obtained through the wavelet packets transformation. The PNN classifier was used to classify the PDs and assess the suitability of this feature vector in PD classification. Four types of artificial PDs were created in a high voltage laboratory, namely corona discharge in air, floating discharge in oil, internal discharge in oil and surface discharge in air, at different applied voltages, and were used to train the PNN algorithm. The results obtained here (97.49, 91.9, 100 and 99.8\{\%\} for the corona, the floating, the internal and the surface discharges, respectively) are very encouraging for the use of PNN in PD classification with this particular feature vector. This article suggests a feature extraction and classification algorithm for PD classification, which when combined together reduced the dimensionality of the feature space to a manageable dimension, and achieved very high levels of classification.

CBM monitoring has been enforced by utilities in the transmission and distribution (T\{\&\}D) environment as part of a predictive maintenance program that aims to result in less unscheduled downtime and lower maintenance cost. Identifying the source of a PD rather than merely assessing its magnitude provides additional information that could enable more educated decisions concerning the integrity of the insulation to be made. In on-line scenarios the presence of multiple PD sources that are simultaneously active as well as the presence of interference, complicates the identification process. In this paper, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm has been employed to identify PDs of different sources. Phase synchronous measurements were acquired in the laboratory and pre-processed through a peak detection algorithm to extract the single pulses (phase asynchronous). To extract a feature the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and Higher Order Statistics (HOS) were employed according to previous work by the authors. The feature was then analyzed by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and study of different PD sources has been shown to form separate clusters. Application of this method on on-line data acquired from the network of the Electricity Authority of Cyprus (EAC) has demonstrated its potential use in PD identification and interference rejection.},

  abstract = {The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method has been used with success in classifying Partial Discharge (PD) data of different sources. In this work it was investigated whether the previous success of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) could be extended to the case where a PD measurement was corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Data was collected from experiments using PDs of different sources under controlled laboratory conditions at the Tony Davies High Voltage Laboratory, University of Southampton. Artificial PD signals were injected into the HV electrode of a bushing and a high frequency current transformer (HFCT) was used to monitor the current between the tap-point and earth. The signals produced by four different artificial PD sources (corona discharge in air, floating discharge in oil, internal discharge in oil and surface discharge in air) were acquired using the peak detection mode of the oscilloscope and were processed to extract the feature that was used by each algorithm. The feature extraction algorithm involved the use of the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) on phase synchronous measurements corrupted by artificial AWGN. Once the SVM was trained using part of the data acquired in the laboratory then the remaining data was corrupted by noise of two different amplitudes, giving SNRs of 7 dB and 3dB. These noisy data were classified using the SVM and the classification results were recorded. This procedure validated the SVM as an effective classification method that can be trained using laboratory noise free PD signals which can subsequently be used to classify field on-line measurements that have been corrupted with noise. \{©\}2010 IEEE.},

Our model is based on two steps. We first use time series clustering techniques to extract common temporal trends of content popularity. Next, we use linear regression models, exploiting as predictors both content features (e.g., numbers of visits and mentions on online social networks) and metrics that capture the distance between the popularity time series to the trends extracted in the first step. We discuss why this model is effective and show its gains over state of the art alternatives.},

However, it is possible that such supposition is violated in practice due to model misspecification or disturbances of the phenomenon not captured by the predictive models. It may lead to statistically biased and/or inefficient predictors. The present paper introduces an approach to correct predetermined forecasters by recursively modeling their remaining residuals. Two formalisms are used to illustrate the recursive approach: the well-known (linear) autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the (non-linear) Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These models are recursively adjusted to the remaining residuals of a given forecaster until a white noise behavior is achieved. Applications involving ARIMA and ANN forecasters for Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, S\{\&\}P500 Index, Google Stock Value, Nasdaq Index, Wolf׳s Sunspot, and Canadian Lynx data series indicate the usefulness of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Results are presented from a monitoring study of the performance of a sample of UK domestic PV systems. Five-minute average climatic and performance data was recorded for 27 PV systems at two sites for up to 2 years of operation. On average, the annual energy losses due to faults were 3.6\{\%\} (Site A, first year of operation), 6.6\{\%\} (Site A, second year of operation) and 18.9\{\%\} (Site B, first year of operation). Simple empirical models are constructed to describe the performance of the PV systems under 'normal operation' (when no faults occur). New analysis techniques are developed which estimate the energy losses of four different fault categories: sustained zero efficiency faults; brief zero efficiency faults; shading; and non-zero efficiency non-shading faults. The results demonstrate that faults have the potential to cause significant energy losses in domestic PV systems. The benefits of applying the data analysis techniques described in this work to PV system clusters and other urban micro-generation technologies are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Different solutions have been proposed for the detection of potential induced degradation (PID), however, none of them has been proven reliable and cost effective so far. Therefore, a detection mechanism is required in the field to warn users for PID development. This paper provides a pathway for the early and reliable detection of PID under outdoor conditions, by characterising the shunt resistance (Rsh) of a solar cell since it is a parameter, which is heavily affected by PID before any significant power occurs and could act as a PID detection mechanism. The paper presents results on the characterisation of the shunt resistance at different PID degradation levels and temperatures in an attempt to assess its potential use as a PID detection means.},

The approach taken is to use a computer procedure to obtain the “best” partition of n objects into g groups. A number of mathematical criteria for “best” are discussed and related to statistical theory. A procedure for optimizing the criteria is outlined. Some of the criteria are compared with respect to their behavior on actual data. Results of data analysis are presented and discussed}

  abstract = {With the increasing use of photovoltaic (PV) systems, the research studies to improve the efficiency of PV systems have gained greater interest in recent years, especially under non-uniform operating conditions. However, there is a little attention on fault diagnosis of PV arrays. This paper develops and demonstrates a method that can efficiently detect the number of open and short circuit faults and discriminate between them and partial shading conditions. This method is based on only the measurement of operating voltage of PV string and ambient temperature. In that manner, the proposed method takes into consideration of the minimum number of sensors to reduce the cost of the system, as one of the main purposes of this study. The simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method under both uniform and non-uniform irradiance conditions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The energy yield delivered by different types of photovoltaic device is a key consideration in the selection of appropriate technologies for cheap photovoltaic electricity. The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module inter-comparisons, as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in inter-comparisons, dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2-7\{\%\} in the course of a year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months. Here, the power rating is a key factor and adds uncertainty for new technologies such as thin films often in the range of 10-15\{\%\}. This dominates inter-comparisons looking at as-new, first-year energy yields, yet considering the life-time energy yield it is found that ageing causes up to 25\{\%\} variation between different devices. The durability of devices and performance-maintenance is thus the most significant factor affecting energy delivery, a major determinant of electricity cost. The discussion is based on long-term measurements carried out in Loughborough, UK by the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University.},

It has become clear that the network architecture needs to evolve to be able to provide current and next generation networking services, both from a performance and implementation point of view. However, most of the current SDN research has looked to specificities of SDN and few have looked from a full stack perspective. Although the former are essential, also the latter perspective needs to be taken into account. In this sense, our work proposes a complete and modular SDN framework targeted at connectivity services. This framework allows the creation and management of network connectivity services over an OpenFlow based network, with mechanisms of fault-management, as well as the optimal usage of the infrastructure. The performance results obtained from the SDN framework evaluation in a real environment show that the three different scenarios, service activation, link loss, and reaction to a new link, are dynamically supported with fast reaction to the network changes.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\$\textbackslash alpha\$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \{\textbackslash AA\} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\{\%\} with default Glide SP settings to 58\{\%\} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\{\%\} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\{\%\} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

To do this, the performance of the modules was measured in operation under ambient conditions with field measurement equipment (AMPROBE Solar Analyzer, Solar – 4000), which allows the extrapolation of measures to standard conditions STC. For the data validation, measures under controlled conditions were taken to some modules in the flash test laboratory of the Institute of Energy Technology ITE of Valencia in Spain. Subsequently the array curves measured were validated with a photovoltaic array model developed in MATLAB-Simulink for the same conditions and technologies. The results of this particular array are lost up to 20\{\%\} of the energy supplied due to the modules mismatch. The study shows the curves and the energy loss due to shadows modules. This result opens scenarios for conceivable modifications to the PV field configurations today, chosen during the design stage and unchangeable during the operating stage; and gives greater importance to the energy loss by mismatch in the PV array.},

  abstract = {The intrinsic performance of 18 broadband radiative models is assessed, using high-quality datasets from five sites in widely different climates. The selected models can predict direct, diffuse and global irradiances under clear skies from atmospheric data, and have all been (or still are) involved in large-scale applications, for instance to prepare solar resource maps and datasets, or to evaluate solar radiation in GIS software. The input data to the models include accurate aerosol and water vapor measurements by collocated sunphotometers, if needed. Cloud occurrences are meticulously scrutinized through the use of various tools to avoid cloud contamination of the test data. The intrinsic performance of the models is evaluated by comparison between their predictions and measurements at high frequency (1-minute time step at four sites, 3-minute at one site). The total expanded uncertainty of these measurements is estimated at 3\{\%\} for direct irradiance, and 5\{\%\} for diffuse and global irradiance.Various statistics are calculated to evaluate the systematic and random differences between the data series, as well as the agreement between the cumulative distribution functions. In the latter case, stringent statistics based on the Komolgorov-Smirnov (KS) test are used. Large differences in performance are apparent between models. Those that require more atmospheric inputs perform usually better than simpler models. Whereas many models can predict the global horizontal irradiance within uncertainty limits similar to those of the radiation measurements, the prediction of direct irradiance is less accurate. Moreover, the prediction of diffuse horizontal irradiance is particularly deficient in most models. The cumulative distribution functions also denote areas of concern.A ranking of all models is proposed, based on four statistical indicators: mean bias difference (MBD), root mean square difference (RMSD), total uncertainty with 95\{\%\} confidence limits (U 95), and the newly introduced Combined Performance Index (CPI), which optimally combines two KS indices with RMSD. For direct irradiance, consistently high rankings are obtained with five models (REST2, Ineichen, Hoyt, Bird, and Iqbal-C, in decreasing order of performance) that require a relatively large number of atmospheric inputs. The inferior performance of models requiring little or no atmospheric inputs suggests that large-scale solar resource products derived from them may be inappropriate for serious solar applications. Additionally, prediction uncertainties under ideal clear-sky conditions can propagate and affect all-sky predictions as well-resulting in potential biases in existing solar resource maps at the continent scale, for instance. \{©\} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In the context of the current rapid development of large-scale solar power projects, the accuracy of the modeled radiation datasets regularly used by many different interest groups is of the utmost importance. This process requires careful validation, normally against high-quality measurements. Some guidelines for a successful validation are reviewed here, not just from the standpoint of solar scientists but also of non-experts with limited knowledge of radiometry or solar radiation modeling. Hence, validation results and performance metrics are reported as comprehensively as possible. The relationship between a desirable lower uncertainty in solar radiation data, lower financial risks, and ultimately better bankability of large-scale solar projects is discussed. A description and discussion of the performance indicators that can or should be used in the radiation model validation studies are developed here. Whereas most indicators are summary statistics that attempt to synthesize the overall performance of a model with only one number, the practical interest of more elaborate metrics, particularly those derived from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, is discussed. Moreover, the important potential of visual indicators is also demonstrated. An example of application provides a complete performance analysis of the predictions of clear-sky direct normal irradiance obtained with six models of the literature at Tamanrasset, Algeria, where high-turbidity conditions are frequent. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this study, a detailed review of the performance of 24 radiative models from the literature is presented. These models are used to predict the clear-sky surface direct normal irradiance (DNI) at a 1-min time resolution. Coincident radiometric and sunphotometric databases of the highest possible quality, and recorded at seven stations located in arid environments, are used for this analysis. At most sites, an extremely large range of aerosol loading conditions and high variability in their characteristics are noticed. At one site (Solar Village), DNI was measured routinely with an active cavity radiometer with very low uncertainty compared to field pyrheliometers, which makes its dataset exceptional. The reviewed models are categorized into 5 classes, depending on the number of aerosol-related inputs they require. One of the models (RRTMG) is considerably more sophisticated (and thus less computationally efficient) than the other models-which are all of the parametric type currently in use in solar applications, and specifically devised for cloudless conditions. RRTMG is more versatile and is selected here for benchmarking purposes. The results show good consistency between the different stations, with generally higher prediction uncertainties at sites experiencing larger mean aerosol optical depth (AOD). Disaggregation of the performance results as a function of two aerosol optical characteristics (AOD at 1 j.im, ft, and Angstrom exponent, a) shows that the simplest parametric models' performance decreases when subjected to turbidity conditions outside of what is "normal" or "typical" under temperate climates. Only a few parametric models perform well under all conditions and at all stations: REST2, CPCR2, MMAC, and METSTAT, in decreasing order of performance. The Ineichen and Hoyt models perform adequately at low AODs, but diverge beyond a specific limit. REST2 is the only parametric model that performs similarly to the RRTMG benchmark under all AOD regimes observed here-and even sometimes better. The inspection of the models' performance when considering the simultaneous effects of both ft and a reveals a clear pattern in the models' error, which is influenced by the frequency distribution of a values. This suggests most models may have difficulty in correctly capturing the effect of a, and/or that observational and instrumental issues at high AOD values may also enhance the apparent model prediction errors. A study of the specific sensitivity of DNI on AOD confirmed previous findings. It is concluded that, assuming a "perfect" model, DNI can be modeled within 5\{\%\} accuracy only if ft is known to within =t 0.02.},

In some Sunbelt countries, PV has become a competitive alternative for electricity generation resulting from a combination of high solar resource, decreasing PV system costs and high fuel prices. The PV levelized cost of electricity has fallen in some regions to 0.08 V/kWh whilst retail electricity prices are almost three times higher in some cases attesting to the ideal conditions in the region for PV uptake. In grid parity regions of south Europe, incentives such as feed-in-tariffs have served their purpose. Net metering and self-consumption are proving to be good solutions for driving effectively the PV market as evidenced for the case of Cyprus. In MENA countries, the renewables policy landscape, although still at an exploratory phase, is rapidly developing providing the backbone for a large number of new PV projects. This reflects the region's commitment to meet its ambitious national targets regarding PV. Overall, the timing for the whole region is excellent to achieve energy sustainability, once better policies are adopted and challenges regarding grid integration and reliability are addressed.},

Both are determined mainly by constraints given by equipment development, calibration schemes and operation routines. Further, an increasing range of PV technologies is available on the market showing rather different spectral responsivities. These require precise PV device calibrations, either outdoor or indoor, with accurate measurement of the light-source. Under these boundary conditions accurate spectrally resolved solar irradiance measurements are gaining higher importance compared to recent years. Finally also PV energy yield estimations (predictions) may benefit from more accurate information on the solar spectrum. The International Spectroradiometer and Broadband intercomparison (ISRC) is evaluating measurement devices, measurement routine and equivalence in measurement results. Last year edition involved 9 scientific institutions and 5 commercial partners of 8 countries, testingmeasurement capabilities and best practices in spectrally resolved solar irradiance between 300 nm and 1700 nm. This work compares results and best practice approaches during the recent years of intercomparison. Capability of precision improvements in measurement as well as deviation in measurement approaches, instruments and institutes are highlighted. The analysis aims to conclude on effects of harmonization efforts, spreading of best-practice.},

This paper briefly reviews our previously-published physical model for calculating degradation and reliability, PVLife, which computes hour-by-hour degradation of PV modules using weather files and degradation sub-models developed from accelerated test data. We then demonstrate a validation of this model against a large statistical data set obtained from 266 systems powered by SunPower modules (data from over 179 systems installed by Powerlight, using non-SunPower modules are also shown). In total these data represent over 800,000 modules and a total of 3.2 million module-years of experience. The data analysis technique requires little manual data processing and can be derived from live sites without special experimental treatment. Uncertainty in the model is discussed, and its utility in a design for reliability program is outlined. We also discuss a Pareto derived from RMA data on both SunPower and non-SunPower modules, and its implications for failure prediction.},

Individual solar cycles are characterized by their maxima and minima, cycle periods and amplitudes, cycle shape, the equatorward drift of the active latitudes, hemispheric asymmetries, and active longitudes. Cycle-to-cycle variability includes the Maunder Minimum, the Gleissberg Cycle, and the Gnevyshev-Ohl (even-odd) Rule. Short-term variability includes the 154-day periodicity, quasi-biennial variations, and double-peaked maxima. We conclude with an examination of prediction techniques for the solar cycle and a closer look at cycles 23 and 24.},

  abstract = {Understanding the degradation behavior of PV modules during long-term operation and developing realistic and effective procedures for accelerated testing that can simulate 25 years of operation requires a reliable database for outdoor weathering and for accelerated testing in the laboratory. To assess the effects of real-life weathering, we set up four test sites covering a wide range of climatic effects in terms of irradiation, ambient temperature and relative humidity. The test sites are located in Cologne, Germany (moderate climate), in Serpong, Indonesia (tropical climate), on the Zugspitze in the German Alps (high mountain climate) and in Sede Boqer in the Negev Desert of Israel (arid climate). The monitoring program surveyed the relevant meteorological parameters and temperatures of various crystalline silicon PV modules for open-rack mounting [1]. Our database covers a period of 3 years and suffices for comparing the weathering effects in the different climates. The database also allows comparisons of load levels under real-life conditions and under the test conditions during the accelerated testing of PV modules as defined by test standard IEC 61215. In an experimental study we subjected various crystalline silicon PV modules to extended thermal cycling and damp heat-testing, exceeding 200 cycles and 1000 hours respectively, in order to assess weaknesses in the module construction. Extended qualification testing revealed enhanced degradation after 2000 hours of testing with damp heat and after 400 cycles in thermal cycling. Standard IEC test conditions therefore do not suffice for determining weaknesses in module construction. The correlation between accelerated laboratory testing and outdoor weathering still requires further research. One particular problem is the question of tolerance ranges in product quality during module production.},

  abstract = {Applications of modern methods for analyzing data with missing values, based primarily on multiple imputation, have in the last half-decade become common in American politics and political behavior. Scholars in these fields have thus increasingly avoided the biases and inefficiencies caused by ad hoc methods like listwise deletion and best guess imputation. However, researchers in much of comparative politics and international relations, and others with similar data, have been unable to do the same because the best available imputation methods work poorly with the time-series cross-section data structures common in these fields. We attempt to rectify this situation. First, we build a multiple imputation model that allows smooth time trends, shifts across cross-sectional units, and correlations over time and space, resulting in far more accurate imputations. Second, we build nonignorable missingness models by enabling analysts to incorporate knowledge from area studies experts via priors on individual missing cell values, rather than on difficult-to-interpret model parameters. Third, since these tasks could not be accomplished within existing imputation algorithms, in that they cannot handle as many variables as needed even in the simpler cross-sectional data for which they were designed, we also develop a new algorithm that substantially expands the range of computationally feasible data types and sizes for which multiple imputation can be used. These developments also made it possible to implement the methods introduced here in freely available open source software that is considerably more reliable than existing strategies.},

  abstract = {A proposal for generating standard climatic data sets for use in energy rating of photovoltaic (PV) modules is presented which will give a good comparability between different technologies. The current proposal of standard data sets consisting of "typical days" do not give realistic estimates of PV performance and thus is not sufficient as a rating standard. A dataset striking the balance between being significant for any location but does not consisting of too much data is required. A method to generate such a dataset is presented, meeting all the requirements of an international standard while being sufficiently accurate to differentiate between different devices of different manufacturers. It is suggested to work with annual data-sets for specific climatic zones, and compare devices based on their module performance ratio. Using geographical information systems and proven modeling approaches, it is demonstrated that seven such annual data sets give sufficient detail and relevance to allow a comparison of different PV device technologies in all European operating environments. The method to use GIS datasets to identify suitable sites and then use more accurate, specific measurement data based on long-term averages for chosen sites. It is shown that the year-to-year variation is minimal, thus making these datasets suitable for comparing typical energy yields of different devices, i.e. carry out an energy rating. The study is currently limited to European data and climatic zones, which is sufficient to derive the methodology for generating and classifying the data. An international standard will, however, need a wider coverage. The extension to other data-sets and climatic zones is proposed and will have to be carried out by the appropriate standards bodies if this is to become an internationally accepted standard. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using Hadoop/HBase for the distributed data warehouse, Energy-CRADLE does not have a predefined data table schema, which enables ingestion of data in diverse and changing formats. For easy data ingestion and data retrieval, Energy-CRADLE utilizes Hadoop streaming to enable Python MapReduce and provides a graphical user interface, i.e., py-CRADLE. By developing the Hadoop distributed computing platform and the HBase NoSQL database schema for solar energy, Energy-CRADLE exemplifies an integrated, scalable, secure, and user-friendly data informatics and analytics system for PV researchers. An example of Energy-CRADLE enabled scalable, data-driven, analytics is presented, where machine learning is used for anomaly detection across 2.2 million real-world current-voltage (I–V) curves of PV modules in three distinct Köppen–Geiger climatic zones.},

  abstract = {Two signal classification methods have been examined to discover their suitability for the task of partial discharge (PD) identification. An experiment has been designed to artificially mimic signals produced by a range of PD sources that are known to occur within high voltage (HV) items of plant. The bushing tap point of a large Auto-transformer has been highlighted as a possible point on which to attach PD sensing equipment and is utilized in this experiment. Artificial PD signals are injected into the HV electrode of the bushing itself and a high frequency current transformer (HFCT) is used to monitor the current between the tap-point and earth. The experimentally produced data was analyzed using two different signal processing algorithms and their classification performance compared. The signals produced by four different artificial PD sources (surface discharge in air, corona discharge in air, floating discharge in oil and internal discharge in oil) have been processed, then classified using two machine learning techniques, namely the support vector machine (SVM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN). The feature extraction algorithms involve performing wavelet packet analysis on the PD signals recorded over a single power cycle. The dimensionality of the data has been reduced by finding the first four moments of the probability density function (Mean, Standard deviation, Skew and Kurtosis) of the wavelet packet coefficients to produce a suitable feature vector. Initial results indicate that very high identification rates are possible with the SVM able to classify PD signals with a slightly higher accuracy than a PNN. \{©\} 2010 IEEE.},

This model is sequentially coupled with an electrical model and energy balance equation. In order to establish the parameter based model, key parameters including the total effective solar energy, total heat exchange coefficient and ambient temperature are calculated from two working points on PV module along with the corresponding temperature from a thermal camera. Using the developed model, a fault diagnosis method based on the model is illustrated. Finally, model validation is carried out by the experiments. \{©\} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The new python-based tool known as NREL/Rdtools has been used to extract the degradation rate of all the PV modules. Sensor irradiance data and clear-sky modeling approach have been used in this work. In general, mono-Si PV modules shows lower degradation compared to poly-Si and thinfilm technologies. The best performing PV modules are both mono-Si that showed degradation rate less than 0.07\%/yr. The worst performing module was a CIGS with 3.9\%/yr and a Poly-Si with 2.9\%/yr. On an average, poly-Si PV modules showed 1.46\%/yr degradation based on solar radiation sensors data while the use of a clear-sky based solar radiation model provides a lower figure of 0.55\%/yr. The dominating degradation in poly-Si PV modules affects Isc, suggesting increased optical losses.},

The Pordis 140A system can extract current and voltage (I-V) while the PV system remains connected to the grid. However, the added visibility for plant owners, investors, and operators is currently not well understood. Therefore, the present work provides an overview of the I-V tracing system in comparison to a typical, inverter data acquisition system for two systems located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Future work is prioritized based upon information assembled from recent installations, and inconsistencies in degradation mode identification are discussed to help guide future publication on this subject. Reported failure rates of photovoltaic modules fall mostly in the range of other consumer products; however, the long expected useful life of modules may not allow for direct comparison. In general, degradation percentages are reported to decrease appreciably in newer installations that are deployed after the year 2000. However, these trends may be convoluted with varying manufacturing and installation quality world-wide. Modules in hot and humid climates show considerably higher degradation modes than those in desert and moderate climates, which warrants further investigation. Delamination and diode/j-box issues are also more frequent in hot and humid climates than in other climates. The highest concerns of systems installed in the last 10\,years appear to be hot spots followed by internal circuitry discoloration. Encapsulant discoloration was the most common degradation mode, particularly in older systems. In newer systems, encapsulant discoloration appears in hotter climates, but to a lesser degree. Thin-film degradation modes are dominated by glass breakage and absorber corrosion, although the breadth of information for thin-film modules is much smaller than for x-Si.

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) reliability and durability have seen increased interest in recent years. Historically, and as a preliminarily reasonable approximation, linear degradation rates have been used to quantify long-term module and system performance. The underlying assumption of linearity can be violated at the beginning of the life, as has been well documented, especially for thin-film technology. Additionally, non-linearities in the wear-out phase can have significant economic impact and appear to be linked to different failure modes. In addition, associating specific degradation and failure modes with specific time series behavior will aid in duplicating these degradation modes in accelerated tests and, eventually, in service life prediction. In this paper, we discuss different degradation modes and how some of these may cause approximately linear degradation within the measurement uncertainty (e.g., modules that were mainly affected by encapsulant discoloration) while other degradation modes lead to distinctly non-linear degradation (e.g., hot spots caused by cracked cells or solder bond failures and corrosion). The various behaviors are summarized with the goal of aiding in predictions of what may be seen in other systems. Published 2016.

  abstract = {Lifetime performance and degradation analysis of laboratory and field deployed PV modules is paramount to the continued success of solar energy. Image characterization techniques capture spatially resolved macroscopic manifestations of microscopic mechanistic behavior. Automated data processing and analytics allow for a large-scale systematic study of PV module health. In this study, degradation features seen in periodic EL images taken during test-to-failure damp-heat, thermal cycling, ultra-violet irradiance, and dynamic mechanical loading accelerated exposures are extracted and classified using supervised and unsupervised methods. Image corrections, including planar indexing to align module images, are applied. On extracted cell images, degradation states such as busbar corrosion, cracking, wafer edge darkening, and between-busbar dark spots can be studied in comparison to new cells using supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The systematic feature groupings provide a scalable method without bias to quantitatively monitor the degradation of laboratory and commercial systems alike. The evolution of these degradation features through varied exposure conditions provides insight into mechanisms causing degradation in field deployed modules. The supervised algorithms used in this application are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). With the increase in data and diversity of features, unsupervised learning can be employed to find relations between inherent image properties. Feature extraction techniques help identify intrinsic geometric patterns formed inthe images due to degradation. Principal component analysis is then applied to the extracted set of features to filter the most relevant components from the set, which are then passed to an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. Google’s Tensorflow library was utilized to enhance the computational efficiency of the CNN model by providing GPUbased parallel matrix operations. Using supervised methods on 5 features an accuracy greater than 98\% was achieved. For unsupervised clustering, the classification was done into two clusters of degraded and non-degraded cells with 66\% coherence.},

In order to assess the robustness of current systems and methods, it is also desirable to focus on time-series scenarios which represent specific time-series features. This work presents a generally applicable and easy-to-use method for the feature-driven generation of time series data. Our approach extracts descriptive features of a data set and allows the construction of a specific version by means of the modification of these features.},

In this work, we make a surprising claim. Clustering of time-series subsequences is meaningless. More concretely, clusters extracted from these time series are forced to obey a certain constraint that is pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by any dataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by any clustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraint can be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and is simple to prove, it has never appeared in the literature. We can justify calling our claim surprising because it invalidates the contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We will justify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and a comprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations of previous work. Although the primary contribution of our work is to draw attention to the fact that an apparent solution to an important problem is incorrect and should no longer be used, we also introduce a novel method that, based on the concept of time-series motifs, is able to meaningfully cluster subsequences on some time-series datasets.},

An I-V curve tracer using a capacitive load is exploited to measure the I-V characteristics of PV arrays. Such measurement allows characterization of PV arrays on-site, under real operating conditions, and provides also information for the detection of potential array anomalies. This I-V curve tracer is based on a microcontroller board family called chipKIT Max32 which is a popular platform for physical computing. A user program can be developed visually on a PC side via the graphical user interface (GUI) in Matlab Simulink, where the chipKIT Max32 of Digilent which is a low-cost board is designed for use with the Arduinompid software. The obtained results from the partial shade default showed the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method and the good functioning of this board with the Matlab/Simulink environment.},

  abstract = {An overview on quality assurance measures for large-scale PV power plants is given. Areas discussed include yield assessment, module testing and power rating, on-site system testing and yield monitoring. In addition, we present a procedure for the analysis of module and system long-term stability using performance monitoring data of systems. For PV systems with standard c-Si modules, calculated rates of change in the initial \{∼\}5-7 years are statistically insignificant. Although this gives confidence about the fairly good long-term stability of c-Si modules, longer monitoring durations may be needed in order to address degradation rates by monitoring data analysis. Concerning PV performances more generally, today's high Performance Ratio is proof that solar PV has matured into both a highly reliable and well-performing technology.},

Because solar power generation is intrinsically highly dependent on weather fluctuations, predicting power generation using weather information has several economic benefits, including reliable operation planning and proactive power trading. This study builds a model that predicts the amounts of solar power generation using weather information provided by weather agencies. This study proposes a two-step modeling process that connects unannounced weather variables with announced weather forecasts. The empirical results show that this approach improves a base approach by wide margins, regardless of types of applied machine learning algorithms. The results also show that the random forest regression algorithm performs the best for this problem, achieving an R-squared value of 70.5\% in the test data. The intermediate modeling process creates four variables, which are ranked with high importance in the post-analysis. The constructed model performs realistic one-day ahead predictions.},

The methods use outdoor measurements to provide performance parameters both at standard reporting conditions and for all operating conditions encountered by typical photovoltaic systems. Improvements over previously used test methods are identified, and examples of the successful application of the methodology are provided for crystalline- and amorphous-silicon modules and arrays. This work provides an improved understanding of module and array performance characteristics, and perhaps most importantly, a straight-forward yet rigorous model for predicting array performance at all operating conditions. For the first time, the influences of solar irradiance, operating temperature, solar spectrum, solar angle-of-incidence, and temperature coefficients are all addressed in a practical way that will benefit both designers and users of photovoltaics.},

  abstract = {The power produced from solar systems depends strongly on the prevailing weather conditions and more precisely on solar irradiance. Due to the dependence of such systems on the weather conditions the electricity injected into the grid is intermittent in nature with potentially negative impact on the grid operation. The quality and quantity of the electrical power produced from solar systems is directly related to the available solar irradiance and therefore any disturbances to the latter affect the produced power. In this paper, the characterisation and classification of the daily solar irradiance from 12 locations in mainland USA is presented based on 4 years of ground measurements. The K-POP method used evaluates the quantity and quality of solar irradiance for a day and as a consequence classifies the day based on these two indices. The statistical analysis of the results shows high correlation through the years for each station. This is a strong indication that the sky conditions are predictable and that with the utilisation of mechanisms, such as storage, spinning reserve, etc. solar systems can become a major contributor to the energy mix. Finally, this analysis provides better insight into the solar resource of a given location.},

In this paper, a new method to track the global MPP is presented, which is based on controlling a dc/dc converter connected at the PV array output, such that it behaves as a constant input-power load. The proposed method has the advantage that it can be applied in either stand-alone or grid-connected PV systems comprising PV arrays with unknown electrical characteristics and does not require knowledge about the PV modules configuration within the PV array. The experimental results verify that the proposed global MPP method guarantees convergence to the global MPP under any partial-shading conditions. Compared with past-proposed methods, the global MPP tracking process is accomplished after far fewer PV array power perturbation steps.},

The fast growing infrastructure of wind turbines can be seen as large sensor system that screens the wind energy at a high temporal and spatial resolution. The resulting databases consist of huge amounts of wind energy time series data that can be used for prediction, controlling, and planning purposes. In this work, we describe WindML, a Python-based framework for wind energy related machine learning approaches. The main objective of WindML is the continuous development of tools that address important challenges induced by the growing wind energy information infrastructures. Various examples that demonstrate typical use cases are introduced and related research questions are discussed. The different modules of WindML reach from standard machine learning algorithms to advanced techniques for handling missing data and monitoring high-dimensional time series.},

Time dependent XRD patterns were collected at constant temperature for four temperatures in the range 420 to 480 °C to extract the first order rate parameters for formation of this phase using the Avrami model. Activation energy of 233.5 (±45) kJ/mol and pre-exponential value 8.3×1013 s-1 were estimated. Extrapolation of the reaction rate to a typical module operating temperature (50 °C) indicated the rate of formation of this complex compound is sufficiently low that the extent of reaction is negligible during the module lifetime of 30 years.},

We discuss prior distributions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

  abstract = {Grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems have become a significant constituent of the power supply mix. A challenge faced by both users and suppliers of PV systems is that of defining and computing a reliable metric of annual degradation rate while in service. This paper defines a new measure to calculate the degradation rate of PV systems from the PV field measured performance ratio (PR). At first, the PR time series is processed by conventional principal component analysis, which yields seasonality as the dominant data feature. The environment, operating conditions, uncertainty, and hardware used for monitoring influence the outdoor measurements unpredictably. These influences are viewed as perturbations that render the dominant feature obtained by PCA unsuitable to be used in a degradation rate definition. Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is proposed to alleviate these effects. The new measure is defined as the area enclosed by the time series of the corrected by the RPCA annual monthly PR values. The degradation rates obtained for different technologies are compared with those obtained in previous studies. The results have shown that the degradation rates estimated by RPCA were in good agreement with previous investigations and provided increased confidence due to mitigation of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is now a key contributor worldwide in the transition towards low-carbon electricity systems. To date, PV commonly receives subsidies in order to accelerate adoption rates by increasing investor returns. However, many aleatory and epistemic uncertainties exist with regard to these potential returns. In order to manage these uncertainties, an innovative probabilistic approach using Bayesian networks has been applied to the techno-economic analysis of domestic solar PV. Empirical datasets from over 600 domestic PV systems, together with national domestic electricity usage datasets, have been used to generate and calibrate prior probability distributions for PV yield and domestic electricity consumption, respectively, for typical urban housing stock. Subsequently, conditional dependencies of PV self-consumption with regard to PV generation and household electricity consumption have been simulated via stochastic modelling using high temporal resolution demand and PV generation data. A Bayesian network model is subsequently applied to deliver posterior probability distributions of key parameters as part of a discounted cash flow analysis. The results illustrate the sensitivity of PV investment returns to parameters such as PV self-consumption, PV degradation rates and geographical location and quantify inherent uncertainties when evaluating the impact of sector-specific PV adoption upon economic indicators. The outcomes are discussed in terms of the value and impact of this new Bayesian approach in terms of supporting robust and rigorous policy and investment decision-making, especially in post-subsidy contexts globally.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes scalable and fast algorithms for solving the Robust PCA problem, namely recovering a low-rank matrix with an unknown fraction of its entries being arbitrarily corrupted. This problem arises in many applications, such as image processing, web data ranking, and bioinformatic data analysis. It was recently shown that under surprisingly broad conditions, the Robust PCA problem can be exactly solved via convex optimization that minimizes a combination of the nuclear norm and the \$\textbackslash ell\^1\$-norm . In this paper, we apply the method of augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) to solve this convex program. As the objective function is non-smooth, we show how to extend the classical analysis of ALM to such new objective functions and prove the optimality of the proposed algorithms and characterize their convergence rate. Empirically, the proposed new algorithms can be more than five times faster than the previous state-of-the-art algorithms for Robust PCA, such as the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm. Moreover, the new algorithms achieve higher precision, yet being less storage/memory demanding. We also show that the ALM technique can be used to solve the (related but somewhat simpler) matrix completion problem and obtain rather promising results too. We further prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the inexact ALM to converge globally. Matlab code of all algorithms discussed are available at http://perception.csl.illinois.edu/matrix-rank/home.html},

We evaluate and compare the performances of different combinations based on the CCC, to determine the indoor accelerated test which is most closely related to real world conditions at each site. The result shows that the cross correlation coefficients among some combinations between the outdoor model and indoor model are over 0.9, and we further compare the trend of I-V features between indoor and outdoor modules to evaluate the degree of similarity of degradation mechanisms between indoor and outdoor modules. The result obtained from these two comparison methods are in good agreement with each other.},

In addition, the performance of different imputation techniques was assessed in order to develop an optimal methodology for treating missing data for degradation rate estimation studies. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the application of the different statistical methods to estimate the annual degradation rate is sensitive to the amount of missing data, since all the statistical methods underestimated the degradation rate consistently with the increasing level of missing data. In addition, the application of the Seasonal Decomposition (Seas) technique yielded robust annual degradation rate estimates since for a level of 40 \% of missing data, the absolute percentage error (APE) of the annual degradation rate estimated with all statistical techniques, was less than 7.5 \%.  Finally, Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD) was shown to be the most robust technique for estimating the degradation rate when imputation was applied, while Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was the most successful technique in providing robust degradation rate estimates when not applying any imputation.},

This can be achieved by improving the reliability and service lifetime performance through constant, solid and traceable PV plant monitoring of installed systems. In this way, the investment cost, levelised cost of electricity (LCoE) and in general PV competitiveness can be enhanced positively. It is with this background that the project "Innovative Performance Monitoring System for Improved Reliability and Optimized Levelised Cost of Electricity"(IPERMON) funded by the SOLAR-ERA.NET Transnational Calls PV3 and CSP3, has been initiated between Gantner Instruments (GI) GmbH and the PV Technology Laboratory of the University of Cyprus (UCY), in order to develop an innovative monitoring system with enhanced capabilities, far beyond the state-of-the-art. The proposed monitoring system will be capable to detect performance losses and failures, determine the degradation rate and provide accurate hourly and day-ahead power production forecasts. The scope of this work is to present the main scientific, technological and commercial objectives of the project in the field of PV performance monitoring systems and to present first results for the formulation and benchmarking of innovative guidelines and algorithms for the detection and diagnosis of performance losses, degradation and failures.},

The scope of this work is to analyse and model the outdoor performance of different grid-connected poly-crystalline Silicon (poly-c Si) PV systems installed at the PV Technology Laboratory of the University of Cyprus (UCY). These systems provided by Hanwha Q CELLS were installed side-by-side at a fixed-plane and monitored for a period of one year. Apart from PV system operational data, meteorological data were also extracted. Specifically, the focus of this ongoing analysis is to compare the performance of different modelling methods against real outdoor energy measurements and to investigate the impact of using real meteorological data for the simulation using the PVWATTS model and the PVSYST simulation software. The annual DC Performance Ratio (PRDC) results using the PVWATTS model and calculated using the PVSYST software showed that the prediction error (PE) was below 2 \% for the PVSYST simulation, whereas for the PVWATTS model PE differences of up to 8 \% were observed when compared to the measured PRDC.},

Another important consideration is the influence of different climatic conditions on the exhibited degradation rates, with warmer operating conditions theoretically affecting module components to a higher extent compared to lower temperatures. The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of the annual performance loss rates of different photovoltaic (PV) systems, ranging from mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si) to multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si) and thin-film technologies, installed in Cyprus over a period of five years. The results of the performance loss rate investigation showed that the mono-c-Si and multi-c-Si systems exhibited average annual performance loss rates that were lower than the 1 \{\%\}/year stated by most PV module manufactures. Conversely, the average annual performance loss rate of the thin-film systems was -1.78 \{\%\}/year.},

  abstract = {Mathematical and empirical models have long been used to describe the output behaviour of photovoltaic (PV) systems. The purpose of this paper is to compare the combined uncertainties inherent in the results when using three of these models; the single-point efficiency, the single-point efficiency with temperature correction and the PVUSA model. This evaluation was performed using outdoor measurement data from 12 different grid- connected PV systems of 1 kWp each, operating in Cyprus since June 2006 along with measurement data from the meteorological sensor network on-site. The models showed a wide variation in combined uncertainties, demonstrating the dependence of accurate energy yield predictions on the model and sensing equipment. In particular, it was shown that the application of temperature correction on the single-point efficiency model using the manufacturer provided temperature coefficients (\$\textbackslash gamma\$MPP) resulted in a reduction of the combined uncertainty. In the case of the single-point efficiency model, the uncertainties were in the name-plate efficiency at standard test conditions (\$\textbackslash eta\$STC) and the global irradiation measured on the plane of array (GPOA), producing a combined uncertainty of ±7\{\%\} on the annual dc energy yield of all PV systems. By applying temperature correction on the model, the combined uncertainties dropped to an average of ±5.60\{\%\}, despite the introduction of additional uncertainties from \$\textbackslash gamma\$MPP and Tmodule. Lastly, the PVUSA model showed even lower combined uncertainties, in the realm of ±1.60\{\%\}. The paper also presents the combined uncertainties inherent in the three models separately for four different years (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010).},

Initially, the energy yield losses due to temperature were investigated based on acquired measurements of module temperature and using the manufacturer's maximum power point (MPP) temperature coefficients, \$\textbackslash gamma\$PMPP. The same thermal loss investigation was also carried out, using the experimentally evaluated \$\textbackslash gamma\$PMPP coefficients for comparison. In the case of the manufacturer's \$\textbackslash gamma\$PMPP, the results showed that the thermal losses in the annual dc energy yield were 3 - 4 \{\%\}. Similar thermal losses were found when using the experimentally evaluated \$\textbackslash gamma\$PMPP. In addition, temperature effects on the seasonal performance were evident on the monthly average performance ratio (PR) values. An increase in performance from spring until early autumn was observed and was attributed to thermal annealing. The effect of thermal annealing on the performance was revealed by filtering dc MPP power measurements at high irradiance (greater than 800 W/m2) and restricting the values at geometric air mass (AM) in the range 1 ≤ geometric AM ≤ 1.5. The extracted dc MPP power was corrected for irradiance and temperature at standard test conditions (STC) using the manufacturer's \$\textbackslash gamma\$PMPP for a period of two years. The effect of thermal annealing was further investigated by extracting dc MPP power measurements at geometric AM in the range 1.4 ≤ geometric AM ≤ 1.6 in order to minimize the spectral effects on the performance of the a-Si system. The results showed that thermal annealing caused a 7.5 \{\%\} increase in power from March to September 2008 and a 7 \{\%\} increase for the same period in 2009.},

  abstract = {The Wiener-Kolmogorov (WK) signal extraction filter, extended to handle nonstationary signal and noise, has minimum Mean Square Error (MSE) among filters that preserve the signal's initial values; however, the stochastic dynamics of the signal estimate typically differ substantially from that of the target. The use of such filters, although widespread, is observed to produce dips in the spectrum of the seasonal adjustments of seasonal time series. These spectral troughs tend to correspond to negative autocorrelations at lags 12 and 24 in practice, a phenomenon that will be called "negative seasonality." So-called "square root" WK filters were introduced by Wecker in the case of stationary signal and noise, to ensure that the signal estimate shared the same stochastic dynamics as the original signal, and thus remove the problem of spectral dips. This represents a different statistical philosophy: not only do we want to closely estimate a target quantity, but we desire that the internal properties and dynamics of our estimate closely resemble those of the target. The MSE criterion ignores this aspect of the signal extraction problem, whereas the square root WK filters account for this issue at the cost of accruing additional MSE. This paper provides empirical documentation of negative seasonality, and provides matrix formulas for square root WK filters that are appropriate for finite samples of nonstationary time series. We apply these filters to produce seasonal adjustments without inappropriate spectral troughs.},

The model solves the coupled electro-thermal equations to calculate PV panel performance for a given set of weather conditions. Based on this calculated operating point and a series of physical sub-models for key degradation and failure modes, the progressive degradation of the panel performance is simulated, creating a second level of coupling. The sub-models describing the different degradation modes are developed based on data from the field and accelerated laboratory tests. To close the loop, the overall model is compared with both laboratory and field data. Coupled degradation modes, including possible feedback loops, are investigated.},

Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique is applied and MATLAB program is developed for reliability analysis of small isolated power system using solar photovoltaic (SPV). This paper is distributed in two parts. Firstly various solar radiation prediction methods along with hourly mean solar radiation (HMSR) method are compared. The comparison is carried on the basis of predicted electrical power generation with actual power generated by SPV system. Estimation of solar photovoltaic power using HMSR method is close to the actual power generated by SPV system. The deviation in monsoon months is due to the cloud cover. In later part of the paper various reliability indices are obtained by HMSR method using MCS technique. Load model used is IEEE-RTS. Reliability indices, additional load hours (ALH) and additional power (AP) reduces exponentially with increase in load indicates that a SPV source will offset maximum fuel when all of its generated energy is utilized. Fuel saving calculation is also investigated. Case studies are presented for Sagardeep Island in West Bengal state of India. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract: A procedure for modelling the distribution of solar spectral irradiance is proposed. It uses both statistical and data mining techniques. As a result, it is possible to simulate solar spectral irradiance distribution using some astronomical parameters and the meteorological parameters solar irradiance, temperature and humidity. With these parameters, the average photon energy and the normalization factor, which characterise the solar spectra, are estimated. First, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test is used to analyse and compare all measured spectra. The k-means data mining technique is subsequently used to cluster all measurements. We found that three clusters are enough to characterise all observed spectra. Finally, an artificial neural network and a multivariate linear regression are estimated to simulate the solar spectral distribution matching certain meteorological parameters. The results obtained show that over 99.98\{\%\} of cumulative probability distribution functions of measured spectra are the same as simulated ones. [Copyright \{\&\}y\{\&\} Elsevier]},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic modules based on thin film technology are gaining importance in the photovoltaic market, and module installers and plant owners have increasingly begun to request methods of performing module quality control. These modules pose additional problems for measuring power under standard test conditions (STC), beyond problems caused by the temperature of the module and the ambient variables. The main difficulty is that the modules' power rates may vary depending both on the amount of time they have been exposed to the sun during recent hours and on their history of sunlight exposure. In order to assess the current state of the module, it is necessary to know its sunlight exposure history. Thus, an easily accomplishable testing method that ensures the repeatability of the measurements of the power generated is needed. This paper examines different tests performed on commercial thin film PV modules of CIS, a-Si and CdTe technologies in order to find the best way to obtain measurements. A method for obtaining indoor measurements of these technologies that takes into account periods of sunlight exposure is proposed. Special attention is paid to CdTe as a fast growing technology in the market. \{©\} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

As a new feature, SEDES2 calculates hourly solar spectral irradiance for clear and cloudy skies from readily available site-specific meteorological data. Based on these hourly spectra, monthly and yearly efficiencies for the solar cells are derived. As a key result the efficiencies of amorphous silicon cells differ by 10\{\%\} between winter and summer months because of spectral effects only. A second intention of this study is to analyse the sensitivity of power and energy rating methods to spectral irradiance but also to total irradiance and cell temperature. As an outcome, a multi-value energy rating scheme applying the concept of "critical operation periods" is proposed.},

This will bring a high pressure on the reduction of OPEX and the improvement of the user experience. Hence, shifting today's manual and semi-automatic network management into an autonomic and intelligent framework will play a vital role in the upcoming 5G system. Based on the cutting-edge technologies, such as Software-Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization, a novel management framework upon the software-defined and Virtualized Network is proposed by EU H2020 SELFNET project. In the paper, the reference architecture of SELFNET, which is divided into Infrastructure Layer, Virtualized Network Layer, SON Control Layer, SON Autonomic Layer, NFV Orchestration and Management Layer, and Access Layer, will be presented.},

  abstract = {Monolithic multi-junction solar cells are becoming prevalent in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems due to their high demonstrated conversion efficiencies. However, these devices often operate at sub-optimal levels due to current mismatch losses arising between each p-n junction as a result of natural variation in the solar spectrum at the earth's surface. The use of quantum wells in solar cell design affords improved control over the spectral response of the cells via band-gap engineering. This makes it possible to tailor the spectral response of a cell for optimum performance under a given annual spectral resource. Establishing the optimum spectral response for a given location is a major challenge of this approach to cell design, and relies heavily on averaged and modelled data based on combinations of satellite and sparse ground measurements. In addition, there is only limited field experience of such technology to date. The purpose of this work is to investigate through experiment the effect of incorporating multi-quantum-well (MQW) structures into photovoltaic cells to respond to a specific range of annual irradiation spectra and to compare the results obtained with those predicted through modelling. A number of triple-junction cells of different design have been placed side-by-side on an accurate solar tracker, and current-voltage characteristics of each taken at regular intervals over a few months. The outputs are then compared to those predicted by a model of cell performance that includes simulated spectra, generated with the SMARTS program, specific to that location and period of time. Results obtained from outdoor testing indicate that the cells designed to provide improved current matching under the spectral conditions in which they have been tested have performed more consistently than conventional cell designs. This is evident when the short-circuit current is normalised to a fixed direct normal irradiation and temperature, and plotted against atmospheric depth. Detailed analysis of the spectral resource is expected to reveal additional information on the performance of the cells.},

Key device characteristics were compiled, including light/dark J–V, quantum efficiency, temperature dependence of Voc and series resistance, photoluminescence, and capacitance spectroscopy, providing important insight into how the devices compare with high-performance Cu(In,Ga)Se2. The record kesterite device was shown to be primarily limited by interface recombination, minority carrier lifetime, and series resistance. The new level of device performance points to the significant promise of the kesterites as an emerging and commercially interesting thin-film technology.

Demand profiles are presented with respect to the long-term seasonal variations, medium-term weekly and short-term diurnal cycles, allowing for the characterisation and presentation of load behaviour at different time-scales. The linear relationships between active and reactive power demands, temperature and power factor variations are quantified using regression analysis, on a per-hour of the day basis, as well as using a sliding-window regression approach for estimating relative coefficients within a seasonal moving window. The paper presents three different approaches for the decomposition of aggregate network demand into the temperature-dependent loads (i.e. thermal heating and cooling loads) and temperature-independent loads, providing important basic information for the application of the “smart grid” functionalities, such as demand-side management, or balancing of variable energy flows from renewable generation.},

The expected growth of connection densities of PV systems in distribution networks coupled to the environmental conditions and in particular the fluctuations in solar irradiance can lead to undesirable variations of power and supply quality. In order to be able to predict the harmonic pollution due to PV generation, measurements of power quality indices were carried out at the output of a PV system for a period of 2 weeks. Then, a typical distribution system was modeled using the statistically obtained outcome of the measurements from the PV system. From the simulation of the chosen distribution system we obtained results for voltage distortion and categorized them based on solar irradiance levels. The procedure was then validated using the EN50160 analysis approach. The most extreme case, the high solar irradiance condition, was subsequently used for the simulation of different concentration scenarios, in order to assess the concentration limits set by power quality indices and the results are presented. \{©\} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The extraction of energy from renewable sources is rapidly growing. The current pace of technological development makes it commercially viable to harness energy from sun, wind, geothermal and many other renewable sources. Because of the negative effects on the environment and the economy, conventional energy sources like natural gas, crude oil and coal are coming under political and economic pressure. Thus, they require a better mix of energy sources with a higher percentage of renewable energy sources. Harnessing energy from renewable sources range from small scale (e.g., a single household) to large scale (e.g., power plants producing several MWs to a few GWs providing energy to an entire city). An inherent characteristic common to all renewable power plants is that power generation is dependent on environmental parameters and thus cannot be fully controlled or planned for in advance. In a power grid, it is necessary to predict the amount of power that will be generated in the future, including those from the renewable sources, as fluctuations in capacity and/or quality can have negative impacts on the physical health of the entire grid as well as the quality of life of its users. As renewable power plants continue to expand, it will also be necessary to determine their optimal sizes, locations and configurations. In addition, management of the smart grid, in which the renewable energy plants are integrated, is also a challenging problem. In this paper we provide a survey on different machine learning techniques used to address the above issues related to renewable energy generation and integration.},

The measurements consisted of continuous current- voltage (I-V) curves from outdoor testing and bi-weekly indoor ratings at standard test conditions (STC) in a solar simulator. In order to accurately evaluate the field performance under varying meteorological conditions, the electrical parameters were extracted from field I-V curves and were then filtered for high irradiance and low angles of incidence, extrapolated to 1000 W/m2 irradiance and corrected for temperature losses. Additionally, the outdoor I-V curves were used to calculate Loss Factor Model (LFM-B) parameters. A comparison of the indoor ratings at STC to each of the two field performance indicators has shown that there was very good agreement with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.9 \{\%\} and 4.47 \{\%\} when using the filtered and corrected PMPP and the LFM-B Performance Factor (PF), respectively. Lastly, the effects of the module's metastable behavior on the performance were analyzed from indoor measurements at STC. It has been shown that the module suffered a degradation rate of 2.36 \{\%\}/year, while the Staebler-Wronski effect and thermal annealing resulted in ±3 \{\%\} variation of the performance, observable throughout the year.},

The results have shown that the RP of crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies was higher during winter. This was also the case for the coppereindium gallium-diselenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) technologies but with lower seasonal amplitude. The amorphous silicon (a-Si) technology exhibited a different seasonal profile, with high RP during summer and autumn and low during winter. In addition, the trends extracted from the application of CSD and X-12-ARIMA on three-year, four-year and five-year RP time series were used to estimate linear performance loss rates. A comparison between standard linear regression (LR), CSD and X-12-ARIMA has shown that CSD and X-12-ARIMA resulted in higher rates overall for c-Si, 1.07 and 0.93\{\%\}/year respectively, but with significantly less uncertainty than LR. Lastly, it was shown that X-12-ARIMA provided statistical inference in the presence of outliers and produced model residuals that were uncorrelated, in contrast to CSD.},

The results showed that applying LR on the time series produced the lowest performance loss rates for most systems, but with significant autocorrelations in the residuals, signifying statistical inaccuracy.

The methodology is based on the installation of a 1 kWp, grid- connected photovoltaic system and 2 additional modules of the same make/model on the POA, with the additional modules connected to a computer controlled dc load. The dc load will keep each module operating at MPP, while performing I-V scans at regular intervals. This serves two purposes: a) the modules are operating and degrading as if they were connected to an inverter that keeps them at full load conditions and b) the I-V scans allow for the periodic measurement of the electrical characteristics of the PV modules, all essential in the study of their degradation. The additional modules will be periodically dismounted from the POA and put on a testbed, to acquire the STC (Standard Test Conditions) rating and the dark I-V characteristics, according to the IEC 60904-1 standard. The grid-connected system will serve as the basis for PV performance evaluation and degradation rate determination from a system standpoint. The paper will present important issues arising when comparing the outdoor and indoor measurements. These are: 1) the spectrum utilization, 2) how the time between when a module is dismounted from the POA and tested under the solar simulator can affect the internal stability of the module, 3) the I-V scanning sweep rate and, 4) the duration of the light pulses of the solar simulator and how the measured Pmax, with mismatch factor (MMF) corrections as described in standard IEC 60904-7, compares to the outdoor measurements of the PV technologies.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing have resulted in the production of highly efficient cells and modules and the significant reduction of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) due to the increased demand for the technology. Two key factors that will increase the demand and reduce the LCOE even further are: 1) improving operations and maintenance (O\&M) to ensure the optimal operation of deployed PV plants, and 2) accurately estimating the well-known effect of gradual performance degradation and guaranteeing their lifetime energy yield. Both of these key factors require active monitoring and supervision of the deployed PV plants, analysis of field measurement data for estimation of the long-term degradation rate, RD with statistical confidence and comparison with the warranty. This analysis will in turn enable the planning of actions to mitigate the causes of low performance and minimize the amount of energy lost. The accurate estimation of the RD for a deployed PV plant will also enable more accurate and precise lifetime energy yield forecasting and stricter performance guarantees, further reducing investment risk and increasing confidence in the technology. This work deals with developing a generalized data analysis methodology based on statistical principles, for estimating the energy degradation rate, using field measurement data from eleven different grid-connected PV plants operating side-by-side since June 2006 at the PV Technology test site of the University of Cyprus. The methodology was designed to provide accurate and robust un-supervised estimation with a measure of uncertainty. Also, it was designed for application on commercial PV plants, where sensor deployment is sparse and data logging capabilities are low due to cost. Therefore, the minimum requirements for the realization of the developed methodology are accurate measurements of power and an accurate measurement of irradiance. The methodology was developed to address four main issues in the field of PV degradation: 1) measurement qualification and creation of a clean data set from uncertain sources, 2) detection of suboptimal performance from the measurement data and assessment of the effect on the actual degradation rate, 3) analysis of time series of constructed performance metrics to extract and analyse the trend in either a linear or non-linear fashion, and 4) substitution of adhoc analyses and empirical parametrisation with formal statistical tests, to enable the applicability of the methodology in an unsupervised way. Therefore, a data pipeline consisting of measurement qualification, creation of performance metrics, detection and treatment of outliers and trend modelling procedures was developed. In addition, the computational expense of implementing such a methodology was explored and alternative ways were proposed to further reduce it. Extensive experimental work has also been performed in order to estimate the RD of the studied PV arrays, under standard test conditions (STC). These experiments were performed ex situ, using high quality laboratory equipment (i.e. flasher, electroluminescence (EL), infrared (IR) thermography), with traceable calibration throughout the evaluation period. Even though the results were more traceable and certain, indoor testing required a significant amount of manual labour and system downtime and introduced risk due to mounting/dismounting and transporting the PV modules to the laboratory. The PV modules under study were characterized in the laboratory and the results were used to benchmark the accuracy of the developed unsupervised methodology. In this way, PV performance measured under a broad spectrum of prevailing meteorological conditions was compared to the results of indoor testing under international standards. This was one of the most important outcomes of this work as this kind of long-term comparison on multiple, co-located PV technologies which were monitored and characterized in a research-grade environment was extremely rare in the bibliography.},

The measurements were made remotely available via a dynamic web site, able to display real-time data and construct graphs of voltage, current and power over time for a specified time interval. The major aspect of this project was the installation of the photovoltaic and data acquisition subsystems and subsequently, the real operation of the system. The installation took place at the University of Cyprus’ Photovoltaic Park, using photovoltaic components and wires whose specifications have been calculated to comply with the project’s specifications and the 16th edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations in the design part of this project. The actual operation of the system has been recorded and the design has been verified. This process was made easier by observing the measurements taken by the data acquisition system and comparing them with the theoretical values. In addition to the design and implementation of the project, this dissertation provides an insight on the status of the photovoltaic market in Cyprus.},

Fifteen-minute average measurements of the array power at the maximum power point, PA, were used to construct time series of the performance ratio, RP, of each array. The time series were analysed with regARIMA and classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) in order to extract the trend. Then, linear regression (LR) was used to calculate the slope. To validate the results, all arrays were disassembled and every module was tested at Standard Test Conditions (STC) in a class A+A+A+ solar simulator, in order to calculate the nominal array degradation rate. Comparison of both methods has shown good agreement between the time series analysis approach and the indoor testing approach, for PV arrays with no identified failures through electroluminescence (EL). On the contrary, for modules with identified failures through EL, the nominal array degradation rate was higher in comparison to the field PLR. Differences between the two methods have been shown to be due to cracked cells, hotspots and spectral response mismatch. Lastly, the comparison has shown that amongst the time series analysis methods, regARIMA produced statistically significant PLR with low uncertainty and the best agreement with the nominal array degradation rates.},

Fifteen-minute average field measurements over their first ten years of operation were used to create a data set, in which invalid measurements were removed and logged system downtimes were corrected based on past performance. The resulting data set was randomly sampled to select data points which were designated as Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) in order to create unbiased artificial outage periods. The same data set was treated with missing data imputation techniques such as imputation by the mean, linear interpolation and imputation by bootstrap. The resulting data sets were then analysed with linear regression (LR), classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) and regARIMA models to extract the trend and estimate the energy degradation rates. The results have shown that regARIMA was the most robust method for up to 10 \% of missing data, the LR and CSD methods were sensitive starting from 2 \% of missing data and that imputation by the bootstrap enhanced the accuracy of the estimated degradation rates up to 20 \% for regARIMA and 40 \% for LR.},

Various current copier cells and their effects on the copied current were investigated. This included techniques for reducing the error caused by charge injection, large current inputs and low output resistance. The result of the investigation was that active current copier cells offered the best performance by solving the low output resistance problem and that capacitors added in parallel to the gate and source of the memory transistor solved the problem of large input currents. The converter was redesigned with active current copier cells which were used to replicate the operation of the original cascode ADC. The same technology with the original cascode ADC was used (Mietec 2.4μm). Simulations done in HSpice have shown that the converter is operating correctly and has decreased the conversion errors by more than 200\%, up to the last stage, when the current is fed into the current comparator. The comparator was kept the same as the original cascode ADC and could not be adapted for use in the new circuit. The error was reduced to less than half though, which proves that this type of converter has potential. The simulations have also shown that the switched-current ADC had a maximum power consumption of 1.45mW /bit, which is less than half the consumption of the original cascode ADC (3mW /bit).},

The statistical trend analysis methods include Linear Regression (LR), Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW) and LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) and were applied on monthly constructed time series of RP, calculated from the fifteen-minute average array DC power at the maximum power point, PA, of each grid-connected PV system. The comparison of the estimated performance loss rates for each technology showed that the average performance loss rate of the c-Si systems was 0.75 ± 0.17 \{\%\}/year. On the other hand, the average performance loss rate for the thin-film systems was 1.95 ± 0.11 \{\%\}/year for all methods, with a 95 \{\%\} confidence interval. The good agreement in the results between the different methods for each system also provided evidence that the performance loss rates have started to converge to a steady value. Finally, it was demonstrated that trend extraction techniques produced similar estimates between them and with very low uncertainty, even with less than five years of outdoor exposure, whereas LR was the least robust method for all technologies, since it was greatly affected by the seasonality and outliers of the time series and needed more years of data to produce reliable estimates.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a review of methodologies for measuring the degradation rate, RD, of photovoltaic (PV) technologies, as reported in the literature. As presented in this paper, each method yields different results with varying uncertainty depending on the measuring equipment, the data qualification and filtering criteria, the performance metric and the statistical method of estimation of the trend. This imposes the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true degradation rate and, subsequently, the effective lifetime of a PV module/array/system and proves the need for defining a standardized methodology. Through a literature search, four major statistical analysis methods were recognized for calculating degradation rates: (1) Linear Regression (LR), (2) Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), (3) AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and, (4) LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS), with LR being the most common. These analyses were applied on the following performance metrics: (1) electrical parameters from IV curves recorded under outdoor or simulated indoor conditions and corrected to STC, (2) regression models such as the Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications (PVUSA) and Sandia models, (3) normalized ratings such as Performance Ratio, RP, and PMPP/GI and, (4) scaled ratings such as PMPP/Pmax, PAC/Pmax and kWh/kWp. The degradation rate results have shown that the IV method produced the lowest RD and LR produced results with large variation and the largest uncertainty. The ARIMA and LOESS methods, albeit less popular, produced results with low variation and uncertainty and with good agreement between them. Most importantly, this review showed that the RD is not only technology and site dependent, but also methodology dependent.},

The second, called MOSNN, is based on artificial intelligence techniques and aims to correct the main systematic and learnable errors of the Numerical Weather Prediction output. The 1-day and 2-day forecast accuracies are analyzed via direct comparison with irradiance data measured in two sites, Rome and Lugano. The paper shows that a considerable reduction in error was achieved using MOSRH model and MOS cascade. The differences between the two sites are discussed in details.

The first part of the experimental study consists of periodic indoor measurements of I- V characteristics on a set of six modules (single, double and triple junction), during a one year period of outdoor exposure. In the second part, light soaking and thermal annealing cycles were performed indoors on the same modules. The goal of the present research is to assess how the performance of a module is affected by the operating conditions, mainly temperature and irradiance, both of which contribute to a seasonal variation in its performance. For this purpose, a quantitative model is developed that takes into account both of these two contributions; the results show a good agreement between experimental and theoretical data. Further developments and model improvements are proposed and discussed.},

With this product commercially available it is important to be able to predict the performance and energy production obtainable from these modules anywhere in the world. The formulas developed to predict crystalline silicon module kWh/kWp performance do not work because for tandem junction a-Si: (1) the temperature coefficients, particularly the one for peak power, are functions of temperature and irradiance. Therefore a single coefficient cannot be used to calculate expected power under different operating conditions; and (2) the output power depends on the history of the module. During operation the module is continually undergoing light induced degradation and thermal annealing},

In a few of these “old systems” equipment is still in place, metering PV electricity output and plane-of-array irradiation. The majority of \{∼\}300 PV power plants in our monitoring campaign today, however, is large-scale and built in the past 10 years. In this paper, we briefly review the historical development of the Performance Ratio (PR) and how average PR for newly built systems increased to almost 90\{\%\}. This rather high PR of 90\{\%\} only holds, however, if calculated by on-site irradiation acquired with c-Si reference cells and for climates comparable with those in Germany. Next, we use about 500 years of monitoring data on aggregate to perform an analysis of variations of the PR over time. To this end, data points at similar environmental conditions are extracted from long-term time series as to calculate so-called “rates-of-change” of the PR. Highly scattered “rates-of-change” are obtained, not allowing the estimation of specific degradation rates on the system level yet. To this end, we finally revisit uncertainties of irradiance sensors and in particular revisit our irradiance sensor re-calibration data.},

Current state-of-the-art PV monitoring systems require module and array topology details or extensive modeling of the PV system. We present a method using an artificial neural network (ANN) which eliminates the need for a priori information by teaching the algorithm “good” performance behavior based on the initial performance of the array. The PHM algorithm was tested on two PV systems under test at the Outdoor Test Facility (OTF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The PHM algorithm was trained using two months of AC power production. The model then predicted the output power of the system using irradiance, wind, and temperature data. Based on the deviation in measured AC power from the AC power predicted by the trained ANN model, system outages and other faults causing a reduction in power were detected. Had these been commercial installations, rather than research installations, an alert for maintenance could have been initiated. Further use of the PHM system may be able to indicate degradation, detect module or inverter failures, or detect excessive soiling.},

This problem, known as mismatch, can reduce the power output of the array and lead to cell degradation through localized heating of individual cells. Such problems can arise simply through the shading of a single cell. rn this paper, which has a substantial tutorial content, three methods of reducing the effects of mismatch are investigated and compared; the use of integral bypass diodes (IBDs), series/paralleled circuit designs and reduced cell shunt resistance. Experiments were performed on arrays incorporating cells with IBDs and their tolerance to shading was tested and compared to arrays with other cell designs. The potential benefits and costs of using IBDs are then assessed and conclusions drawn about the relative effectiveness of this strategy. The circuit design strategy known as series/paralleling is described and analysed and its effect on minimizing mismatch power loss is evaluated, Also, an expression for the optimum cell shunt resistance in a general shaded array is derived and the technique of reducing cell shunt resistance to minimize mismatch effects is assessed.},

  abstract = {Key reliability and engineering lessons that were learned from the 20-year history of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Flat-Plate Solar Array Project and thin-film module reliability research activities are presented and analyzed. Particular emphasis is placed on lessons applicable to evolving new module technologies and the organizations involved with these technologies. The user-specific demand for reliability is a strong function of the application, its location, and its expected duration. Lessons relative to effective means of specifying reliability are described, and commonly used test requirements are assessed from the standpoint of which are the most troublesome to pass, and which correlate best with field experience. Module design lessons are also summarized, including the significance of the most frequently encountered failure mechanisms and the role of encapsulant and cell reliability in determining module reliability. Lessons pertaining to research, design, and test approaches include the historical role and usefulness of qualification tests and field tests.},

The model takes into account the series and parallel (shunt) resistance of the panel. The equivalent circuit and the basic equations of the PV cell/panel in Standard Test Conditions (STC)1 are shown, as well as the parameters extraction from the data-sheet values. The temperature dependence of the cell dark saturation current is expressed with an alternative formula, which gives better correlation with the datasheet values of the power temperature dependence. Based on these equations, a PV panel model, which is able to predict the panel behavior in different temperature and irradiance conditions, is built and tested.},

Our methods consider a seasonal univariate time series as a functional time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by applying functional principal component analysis to the historical observations, and then to use univariate time series forecasting and functional principal component regression techniques. When data in the most recent year are partially observed, we improve point forecast accuracy by using dynamic updating methods. We also introduce a nonparametric approach to construct prediction intervals of updated forecasts, and compare the empirical coverage probability with an existing parametric method. Our approaches are data-driven and computationally fast, and hence they are feasible to be applied in real time high frequency dynamic updating. The methods are demonstrated using monthly sea surface temperatures from 1950 to 2008. \{©\} 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The analysis of current and voltage indicators have demonstrated effectiveness in the detection of permanent faults in the PV array in real time as short-circuits or open circuits present in the system. In this paper, the analysis of the evolution of these indicators is focused on the detection of temporary faults due to partial shade on the PV array or disconnection of the inverter in case of grid fluctuations of voltage or frequency to prevent islanding. These situations can be identified by observation of the evolution of both indicators and power losses due to these effects can be evaluated from them. The analysis and experimental validation were carried out in two grid connected PV systems in Spain and Algeria.},

The fault detection algorithm is based on the comparison of simulated and measured yields by analyzing the losses present in the system while the identification of the kind of fault is carried out by analyzing and comparing the amount of errors deviation of both DC current and voltage with respect to a set of errors thresholds evaluated on the basis of free fault system.

The period of outdoor exposure ranges from January 2011 to December 2015. The degradation rate and the stabilization period are analysed by using two different techniques. Moreover, the evolution of the fill factor and performance ratio is assessed. The CdTe module was found to have the highest degradation rate: −4.45\%/year, while the CIS module appears to be the most stable with a degradation rate of −1.04\%/year. The a-Si:H and a-Si:H/μc-Si:H modules present stabilization periods of 24 and 6months respectively. The CdTe module degrades significantly for a period of 32months, while the CIS module is the least degraded PV specimen over the whole experimental campaign.},

The procedure to calculate the thresholds that allow the identification of the faults is described. A simulation study was carried out to verify the evaluation of current and voltage indicators and their corresponding thresholds for a set of PV systems with different sizes and different configurations of interconnection of PV modules. The developed method was experimentally validated and has demonstrated its effectiveness in the detection of main faults present in grid connected applications. The computational analysis has been reduced and the number of monitoring sensors minimized. The fault detection procedure can be integrated into the inverter without using simulation software or additional external hardware. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The amounts of committed project funding, as of May 1, 1989, for Phase 1 (to December 31, 1990) and their relative percentages are as follows: The main goals for PVUSA are to assess promising photovoltaic (PV) technologies in a side-by-side utility setting, with the aim of cost-effective commercialization by the mid-1990s; and to create a program to transfer PV knowledge between government, the PV industry, and other utilities. Two 20 kW arrays are now installed in Davis, and the completion of three more is expected this year. Award negotiations are now under way to procure additional 20 kW arrays and several Utility Scalable (US) PV systems that will include tracking and fixed structures and use innovative balance of system designs. These US systems will be either 200 or 400 kW. PVUSA has adopted rating criteria that allow array/system peak performance to be described under outdoor operating conditions. This method for describing performance is believed to be more useful to utility users than extrapolation of data from PV modules flash-tested in a laboratory. A simple regression model is used to rate each system at the PVUSA Test Conditions based on about 30 days of measured outdoor data. The resulting equation can be used by other utilities to site a duplicate system hypothetically in their own territory.}

  abstract = {We discuss results of our investigations toward understanding bulk and surface components of light-induced degradation (LID) in low-Fe c-Si solar cells. The bulk effects, arising from boron-oxygen defects, are determined by comparing degradation of cell parameters and their thermal recovery, with that of the minority-carrier lifetime () in sister wafers. We found that the recovery of t in wafers takes a much longer annealing time compared to that of the cell. We also show that cells having SiN:H coating experience a surface degradation (ascribed to surface recombination). The surface LID is seen as an increase in the q/2kT component of the dark saturation current (J02). The surface LID does not recover fully upon annealing and is attributed to degradation of the SiN:H-Si interface. This behavior is also exhibited by mc-Si cells that have very low oxygen content and do not show any bulk degradation.},

This study, which involves the long-term outdoor exposure in a hot and humid climate, intends to address the performance degradation and failure mechanisms which are difficult or impossible to simulate in the lab during time constrained accelerated tests. Experimental data including irradiance, temperature, DC/AC current and voltage has been collected on diverse generations of photovoltaic modules installed throughout the state of Florida. Long term module reliability and lifetime are evaluated using a two pronged approach. 1) Modules have been deployed outdoors for long time periods with systematic - 15 minutes interval- climatic and performance measurements 2) Real-time climatic and performance measurements of modules following long-term outdoor exposed. Visual, IR and electrical insulation inspections were performed are also presented in this paper. Multiple analytical methods are used to quantify energy production and power degradation over time, including Performance Ratio analysis, and PVUSA regression analysis. Real-time field measurements were reviewed for both overall return rates and compare them with the nameplate performance values and to identify the failure mechanism that caused the return.},

These concepts are demonstrated on a crystalline silicon photovoltaic module that was subjected to several rounds of mechanical loading and humidity-freeze cycling, causing increasing levels of solar cell cracks. The proposed method can be used as a diagnostic tool to rate cell damage or quality of modules after transportation. Moreover, the method can be automated and used in quality control for module manufacturers, installers, or as a diagnostic tool by plant operators and diagnostic service providers.},

  abstract = {PV performance models are used to predict how much energy a PV system will produce at a given location and subject to prescribed weather conditions. These models are commonly used by project developers to choose between module technologies and array designs (e.g., fixed tilt vs. tracking) for a given site or to choose between different geographic locations, and are used by the financial community to establish project viability. Available models can differ significantly in their underlying mathematical formulations and assumptions and in the options available to the analyst for setting up a simulation. Some models lack complete documentation and transparency, which can result in confusion on how to properly set up, run, and document a simulation. Furthermore, the quality and associated uncertainty of the available data upon which these models rely (e.g., irradiance, module parameters, etc.) is often quite variable and frequently undefined. For these reasons, many project developers and other industry users of these simulation tools have expressed concerns related to the confidence they place in PV performance model results. To address this problem, we propose a standardized method for the validation of PV system-level performance models and a set of guidelines for setting up these models and reporting results. This paper describes the basic elements for a standardized model validation process adapted especially for PV performance models, suggests a framework to implement the process, and presents an example of its application to a number of available PV performance models.},

The TFPV modules are: a-Si:H/μc-Si:H (micromorph) and copper indium selenide (CIS). The TFPV modules were characterised by measuring their I-V curves during three years under the same outdoor climate conditions, where the measurement of weather parameters were also performed. The goal of the analysis is to evaluate the degradation rates of the TFPV modules in semi-arid climate. The analysis is based on two techniques, the effective peak power of PV module and power irradiance technique. It was found that TFPV modules CIS and micromorph exhibit a degradation rate of −2.34\%/year and −1.73\%/year respectively. The calculated degradation rate for CIS technology is higher than those reported in the literature for locations in Europe and lower than those for locations with hot and humid conditions. In the opposite the degradation rate of the micromorph was lower than those given in the literature.},

We define an anomaly as an observation that is very unlikely given the recent distribution of a given system. The proposed framework first forecasts a boundary for the system's typical behavior using extreme value theory. Then a sliding window is used to test for anomalous series within a newly arrived collection of series. The model uses time series features as inputs, and a density-based comparison to detect any significant changes in the distribution of the features. Using various synthetic and real world datasets, we demonstrate the wide applicability and usefulness of our proposed framework. We show that the proposed algorithm can work well in the presence of noisy non-stationarity data within multiple classes of time series. This framework is implemented in the open source R package oddstream. R code and data are available in the supplementary materials.},

  abstract = {Outliers due to technical errors in water-quality data from in situ sensors can reduce data quality and have a direct impact on inference drawn from subsequent data analysis. However, outlier detection through manual monitoring is unfeasible given the volume and velocity of data the sensors produce. Here, we proposed an automated framework that provides early detection of outliers in water-quality data from in situ sensors caused by technical issues.The framework was used first to identify the data features that differentiate outlying instances from typical behaviours. Then statistical transformations were applied to make the outlying instances stand out in transformed data space. Unsupervised outlier scoring techniques were then applied to the transformed data space and an approach based on extreme value theory was used to calculate a threshold for each potential outlier. Using two data sets obtained from in situ sensors in rivers flowing into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, Australia, we showed that the proposed framework successfully identified outliers involving abrupt changes in turbidity, conductivity and river level, including sudden spikes, sudden isolated drops and level shifts, while maintaining very low false detection rates. We implemented this framework in the open source R package oddwater.},

A relationship of the IV degradation with the IR images is discussed. Results from laboratory LID tests at room temperature are performed parallel to the outdoor degradation of PV modules. It was found that the total LID, measured on the module level, after the initial 40 hours is similar for both materials resulting in approximately 1.0\{\%\} degradation of the maximum module power output.

The goal of this research was to develop a methodology for estimating the uncertainty in PV yield predictions and to identify avenues for reducing this uncertainty. In this case study, uncertainties were estimated to be about 3.9\{\%\} for year-to-year climate variability, 5\{\%\} for long-term average horizontal insolation, 3\{\%\} for estimation of radiation in the plane of the array, 3\{\%\} for power rating of modules, 2\{\%\} for losses due to dirt and soiling, 1.5\{\%\} for losses due to snow and 5\{\%\} for other sources of error. Uncertainties due to ageing and system availability were also considered. By performing statistical simulations with the Solar Advisor Model software, it was found that the combined uncertainty (standard deviation) is approximately 8.7\{\%\} for the first year of operation, and 7.9\{\%\} for the average yield over the PV system lifetime. While these numbers could vary significantly from one system to the next, the methodology developed is widely applicable. Moreover, a simpler methodology was also explored which should yield quick and fairly reliable estimates of uncertainty. Finally, avenues for reducing yield uncertainties were identified, including: increasing the reliability and resolution of solar radiation estimates, including measurements of irradiance in non-horizontal planes at high quality ground stations, reducing the uncertainty in module ratings and investigating losses that have not been well documented such as those due to dirt, soiling and snow. \{©\} 2011 Crown \{©\} 2013 and Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a modified current-voltage relationship for the single-diode model. The single-diode model has been derived from the well-known equivalent circuit for a single photovoltaic (PV) cell. A cell is defined as the semiconductor device that converts sunlight into electricity. A PV module refers to a number of cells connected in series and in a PV array, modules are connected in series and in parallel. The modification presented in this paper accounts for both parallel and series connections in an array. Derivation of the modified current-voltage relationships begins with a single solar cell and is expanded to a PV module and finally an array. Development of the modified current-voltage relationship was based on a five-parameter model, which requires data typically available from the manufacturer. The model accurately predicts voltage-current (V- I) curves, power-voltage (P- V) curves, maximum power point values, short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage across a range of irradiation levels and cell temperatures. The versatility of the model lies in its accurate prediction of the aforementioned criteria for panels of different types, including monocrystalline and polycrystalline silicon. The model is flexible in the sense that it can be applied to PV arrays of any size, as well as in simulation programs such as EMTDC/PSCAD and MatLab/Simulink. Accuracy of the model was validated through a series of experiments performed outdoors for different configurations of a PV array. \{©\} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Global solar broadband irradiance on a planar surface is measured at weather stations by pyranometers. In the case of the present research, solar radiation values from nine meteorological stations of the MeteoGalicia real-time observational network, captured and stored every ten minutes, are considered. In this kind of record, the lack of data and/or the presence of wrong values adversely affects any time series study. Consequently, when this occurs, a data imputation process must be performed in order to replace missing data with estimated values. This paper aims to evaluate the multivariate imputation of ten-minute scale data by means of the chained equations method (MICE). This method allows the network itself to impute the missing or wrong data of a solar radiation sensor, by using either all or just a group of the measurements of the remaining sensors. Very good results have been obtained with the MICE method in comparison with other methods employed in this field such as Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The average RMSE value of the predictions for the MICE algorithm was 13.37\{\%\} while that for the MLR it was 28.19\{\%\}, and 31.68\{\%\} for the IDW.},

Many forecasting models are designed from a generic statistical point of view. However, each real-world application requires domain-specific adaptations to obtain high-quality results. All such specifics are summarized by the term of context. In contrast to current approaches, we want to integrate context as the primary driver in the forecasting process. We introduce context-driven time series forecasting focusing on two exemplary domains: renewable energy and sparse sales data. In view of this, we discuss the challenge of context integration in the individual process steps.},

  abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into local energy distribution networks becomes increasingly important. Renewable energy highly depends on weather conditions, making it difficult to maintain stability in such networks. To still enable efficient planning and balancing, forecasts of energy supply are essential. However, typical distribution networks contain a variety of heterogeneous RES installations (e.g. wind, solar, water), each providing different characteristics and weather dependencies. Additionally, advanced meters, which allow the communication of final-granular production curves to the network operator, are not available at all RES sites. Despite these heterogeneities and missing measurements, reliable forecasts over the whole local distribution network have to be provided. This poses high challenges on choosing the right input parameters, statistical models and forecasting granularity (e.g. single RES installations vs. aggregated data). In this paper, we will discuss such problems in energy supply forecasting using a real-world scenario. Subsequently, we introduce our idea of a generalized optimization approach that determines the best forecasting strategy for a given scenario and sketch research challenges we are planning to investigate in future work.},

In this paper, a classification of solar forecasting solutions proposed in the literature is provided for both weather- and energy forecast models.

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range ofmodels under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

Experimental work in this field is expensive and limited by hardware and environmental resources. The available commercial simulation tools do not rigorously model the complex behaviour of PV systems operating under non-uniform conditions. In this paper a detailed cell-by-cell model of large scale PV systems is developed. The parameter set used for simulations is based on real PV modules power tolerance data and the variance in its principal parameters, thus representing a realistic power frequency distribution. The model is used to estimate and analyse losses due to circuit mismatch, analyse the causes of reverse current in the system's strings and its consequences in the system performance and to estimate energy losses due to string's fuses failures.},

It is found that Poly-Si modules perform very well even after 10 years of span whereas some of a-Si modules have visual degradation which causes significant power losses.

The model, validated against three full years of data collected from our outdoor test field for amorphous (a-Si) and crystalline (c-Si) silicon PV modules, agrees well in describing the energy performance of both technologies, including their peculiar counter-cyclical seasonal oscillations. The model focuses on clear-sky conditions and on four main loss/gain mechanism: (1) temperature, (2) spectral-effects, (3) reflection, and (4) irradiance, with the addition for a-Si of the Staebler-Wronsky effect. From the device side, the model requires a limited characterisation of the device under test: (a) power rating, (b) temperature coefficients, (c) spectral, (d) angle-of-incidence response and (e) irradiance dependence. Compared to approaches that are more conventional, our model, rather than focusing on the instantaneous power, concentrates on the large picture and directly attempts at providing a description of the daily performance ratio of the device allowing us to introduce a number of simplifications and, most notably, work with much smaller data sets. Input for our simulations are daily aggregate meteorological, and solar data weighted on the irradiance profile. For the a-Si device, slight discrepancies on the long term are attributed to an intrinsic degradation of the module's energy performance, which is not observed for c-Si. Moreover, for the devices investigated in this work we show that by neglecting the irradiance dependence parameter the model can further be simplified without loss of accuracy.},

  abstract = {RSVDPACK is a library of functions for computing low rank approximations of matrices. The library includes functions for computing standard (partial) factorizations such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and also so called "structure preserving" factorizations such as the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) and the CUR decomposition. The ID and CUR factorizations pick subsets of the rows/columns of a matrix to use as bases for its row/column space. Such factorizations preserve properties of the matrix such as sparsity or non-negativity, are helpful in data interpretation, and require in certain contexts less memory than a partial SVD. The package implements highly efficient computational algorithms based on randomized sampling, as described and analyzed in [N. Halko, P.G. Martinsson, J. Tropp, "Finding structure with randomness: Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions," SIAM Review, 53(2), 2011], and subsequent papers. This manuscript presents some modifications to the basic algorithms that improve performance and ease of use. The library is written in C and supports both multi-core CPU and GPU architectures.},

B 32 (1970) 350; Biometrics 26 (1970) 23)), generates distributions of differences in goodness-of-fit expected under each of the competing models. In the data informed version of the PBCM, the generating models have specific parameter values obtained by fitting the experimental data under consideration. The data informed difference distributions can be compared to the observed difference in goodness-of-fit to allow a quantification of model adequacy. In the data uninformed version of the PBCM, the generating models have a relatively broad range of parameter values based on prior knowledge. Application of both the data informed and the data uninformed PBCM is illustrated with several examples.},

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

As a means of reducing MML, newly fabricated PV modules are sorted to meet a set tolerance for variation in overall maximum power output with respect to a given module's rated power. Starting with flash test data sets for two different polycrystalline PV modules and a simulated sorting procedure, Monte Carlo techniques were used to generate a large number of artificial PV arrays. The MMLs for each of these arrays were then calculated to assess the sorting procedure's ability to reduce MML. Overall MMLs were quite small (0.001–0.01\{\%\}). Sorting by Imp resulted in themost consistentMML reductions. Sorting by Vmp yielded insignificant results. Sorting by Pmp yielded significant MML reduction in only one of the two PV module data sets. Analysis was conducted to quantify if additional sorting on top ofwhat bothmanufacturers had already donewouldmake economic sense. Based on high level economic analysis, it appears that additional sorting yields little economic gain; however, this is highly dependent uponmanufacturer sorting cost.},

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by major needs for fast and accurate on-line data analysis tools in the emerging electric energy systems, due to the recent penetration of distributed green energy, distributed intelligence, and plug-in electric vehicles. Instead of taking the traditional complex physical model based approach, this paper proposes a data-driven method, leading to an effective early event detection approach for the smart grid. Our contributions are: (1) introducing the early event detection problem, (2) providing a novel method for power systems data analysis (PowerScope), i.e. finding hidden power flow features which are mutually independent, (3) proposing a learning approach for early event detection and identification based on PowerScope. Although a machine learning approach is adopted, our approach does account for physical constraints to enhance performance. By using the proposed early event detection method, we are able to obtain an event detector with high accuracy but much smaller detection time when comparing to physical model based approach. Such result shows the potential for sustainable grid services through real-time data analysis and control.},

  abstract = {Long-term reliability is critical to the cost effectiveness and commercial success of photovoltaic (PV) products. Today most PV modules are warranted for 25 years, but there is no accepted test protocol to validate a 25-year lifetime. The qualification tests do an excellent job of identifying design, materials, and process flaws that are likely to lead to premature failure (infant mortality), but they are not designed to test for wear-out mechanisms that limit lifetime. This paper presents a method for evaluating the ability of a new PV module technology to survive long-term exposure to specific stresses. The authors propose the use of baseline technologies with proven long-term field performance as controls in the accelerated stress tests. The performance of new-technology modules can then be evaluated versus that of proven-technology modules. If the new-technology demonstrates equivalent or superior performance to the proven one, there is a high likelihood that they will survive versus the tested stress in the real world. INTRODUCTION},

  abstract = {Contributions of different light-induced defect states to degradation of solar cells have been established for high-quality p-i-n solar cells with i layers of protocrystalline a-Si:H deposited at very low rates, whose nanostructure is dominated by hydrogen- passivated divacancies. Nature of the different light-induced gap states and their respective roles as electron and hole recombination centers were characterized in the thin films from their photocur- rents, and in corresponding solar cells from their Shockley–Reed– Hall carrier recombination currents. The results were directly re- lated to three light-induced states, with “A” and “B” within 0.2 eV and “C” 0.4 eV below midgap, identified from subgap absorption. The A and B states are efficient electron, while the C states are very efficient hole recombination centers. Under 1-sun illumina- tion, the former dominate the electron lifetimes, while the latter are key to solar cell operation as is confirmed by the direct cor- relation of their creation with the degradation of VOC and 1-sun fill factor (FF). It is also shown that the apparent correlation found earlier between the cell FF and electron lifetimes is due to the same long-term degradation kinetics of the light-induced changes in the B t and C states.},

  abstract = {The effects of current mismatch and shading on the power output of single photovoltaic (PV) modules are well analyzed, but only few investigations address mismatch losses at a PV system level that also limit the annual energy yield. The simple question, what happens if PV strings with different numbers of modules are connected in parallel, has not yet been discussed in detail. In case of strings with unequal module count, the system builder must decide whether to use inverters with multiple maximum power point (MPP) trackers, module-power optimizers, or to shorten all strings for balancing the system. Our findings from this study open a new option. The numerical modeling of PV systems with strings of different length in parallel to several others which have an equal module count renders mismatch losses below 1\{\%\} for most system configurations. For configurations where one string is one module shorter than the others, the mismatch losses fall below 0.5\{\%\}. Therefore strings with unequal length may favorably connect to a cost-effective single-MPP inverter without causing significant energy yield losses. Moreover, typical thin film PV modules are less sensitive to mismatch than crystalline silicon based ones. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Modeling and simulation of photovoltaic (PV) power systems have become increasingly important with wide acceptance and integration of solar energy in modern electric grids. The transcendental nonlinear equations describing the PV generator, which are coupled with the detailed switching models of the power electronic converters, generally result in slow and inefficient simulations, especially when long-term analyses are required. This paper focuses on simple and efficient modeling approaches that are suitable for long-term and large PV system analyses. This study provides a simplified PV-cell model and its parameterization, guaranteeing that the I–V characteristic curves pass through the typical points given in manufacturers' datasheets. Furthermore, several power interface models are provided for fast simulation purpose. A classical two-stage power processing system with intermediate dc link used as a string inverter, as well as a single-stage conversion unit used in distributed module-dedicated PVapplications, are taken as application examples. The generalized modeling approach is thoroughly evaluated by comparing the simulation results with the experimental data of a practical 2.4-kW grid-tied PV solar unit. The proposed methodology is shown to have advantages over conventional modeling approaches to simulate long-term grid-tied operation.},

This exploits the key benefits of ICN, enabling individual network operators to improve the performance of their IP-based services, without changing the rest of the Internet. We provide an overview of POINT and outline how it improves upon IP in terms of performance and resilience.

Information-Centric Networking (ICN), with its native support for multicast seems ideal for such services, but it requires operators and users to overhaul their networks and applications. The POINT project has proposed a hybrid, IP-over-ICN, architecture, preserving IP devices and applications at the edge, but interconnecting them via an SDN-based ICN core. This allows individual operators to exploit the benefits of ICN, without expecting the rest of the Internet to change. In this paper, we first outline the POINT approach and show how it can handle multicast-based IPTV services in a more efficient and resilient manner than IP. We then describe a successful trial of the POINT prototype in a production network, where real users tested actual IPTV services over both IP and POINT under regular and exceptional conditions. Results from the trial show that the POINT prototype matched or improved upon the services offered via plain IP.},

Three years of outdoor monitoring data are used to extract degradation trends of the performance of the various modules. Statistical decomposition methods are used to extract trends for performance ratio (PR), short-circuit current (\{\$\}\{\{\}I\{\_\}\{\{\}rm SC\{\}\}\{\}\}\{\$\}), open-circuit voltage (\{\$\}\{\{\}V\{\_\}\{\{\}rm OC\{\}\}\{\}\}\{\$\}), and fill factor (FF). The degradation rates of the monocrystalline Si modules are found to be equal to or less than -0.8\{\%\} per year, mainly contributed by the decrease in \{\$\}\{\{\}I\{\_\}\{\{\}rm SC\{\}\}\{\}\}\{\$\}. The multicrystalline Si module shows a slightly higher degradation rate of -1.0\{\%\} per year. The amorphous Si, micromorph Si, and CdTe modules show degradation rates of around -2\{\%\} per year. The CIGS module showed an exceptionally high degradation rate of -6\{\%\} per year. The decrease in FF and \{\$\}\{\{\}V\{\_\}\{\{\}rm OC\{\}\}\{\}\}\{\$\} is found to be significant for all the thin-film modules but not for the crystalline silicon modules.},

  abstract = {This pair of articles presents the results of a study about forecasting photovoltaic (PV) electricity production for some power plants in mainland France. Forecasts are built with statistical methods exploiting outputs from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Contrary to most other studies, forecasts are built without using technical information on the power plants. In each article, several statistical methods are used to build forecast models and their performance is compared by means of adequate scores. When a best forecast emerges, its characteristics are then further assessed in order to get a deeper insight of its merits and flaws. The robustness of the results are evaluated with an intense use of cross-validation.This article deals with probabilistic forecasts of daily production 2. days ahead. By "probabilistic" we mean that our forecast models yield some quantiles of the expected production's probability distribution. Whereas probabilistic forecasts are quite usual in wind power forecasting, they are more unusual in the field of PV production forecasting. We show that our eight forecasts always perform better than a simple climatological reference forecast. Nevertheless, no forecast model clearly dominates the other, whatever the studied power plant. A post-processing technique aiming at improving forecasts may in fact decrease their performance. Finally, we use outputs from an ensemble NWP model in order to add information about the meteorological forecast uncertainty. Sometimes this ensemble improves the performance of forecasts, but this is not always true. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this part of our study, predictors comes from ARPEGE, M??t??o France's deterministic NWP model. Our best model is very reliable and performs well, even compared to best expectable performances computed while using observations as predictors. It also points at the interest of using predictors based on human forecasters' experience. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix (the principal components) from a high-dimensional data matrix despite both small entry-wise noise and gross sparse errors. Recently, it has been shown that a convex program, named Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), can recover the low-rank matrix when the data matrix is corrupted by gross sparse errors. We further prove that the solution to a related convex program (a relaxed PCP) gives an estimate of the low-rank matrix that is simultaneously stable to small entrywise noise and robust to gross sparse errors. More precisely, our result shows that the proposed convex program recovers the low-rank matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted, with an error bound proportional to the noise level. We present simulation results to support our result and demonstrate that the new convex program accurately recovers the principal components (the low-rank matrix) under quite broad conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first result that shows the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), optimal for small i.i.d. noise, can be made robust to gross sparse errors; or the first that shows the newly proposed PCP can be made stable to small entry-wise perturbations.},
