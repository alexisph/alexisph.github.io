  abstract = {Latest trends in the photovoltaic sector see the use of innovative photovoltaic technologies with extended spectral responsivity ranging from 300 to 1200\,nm for non-concentrating terrestrial applications, and to 1800\,nm for concentrating PV and space applications. As a consequence, an update of the IEC 60904-9 standard is ongoing with a definition of new spectral ranges for the assessment of the spectral match. This poses new challenges to laboratories and research centers on whether or not they still are able to accurately measure the spectral mismatch of their sun simulator in the newly-defined spectral regions. Prior to that, there is a need to understand if the commercially available spectroradiometers are ready to extend their measurement range as prescribed by the forthcoming new standard. This paper analyses two options for an extension of the spectrum characterisation of solar simulators to 300\textendash 1200\,nm and compares them in terms of spectral match of global normal irradiance (GNI) spectra acquired under natural sunlight by eight spectroradiometers during the 6th European Spectroradiometer Intercomparison. The acquired spectra are also compared in terms of an index of consistency of the spread of the measured spectra with the estimated measurement uncertainty, hereafter named as performance statisticsEn. Results show that all investigated laboratories assure the equivalence of the spectral match classification well below the 25\% limit corresponding to class-A simulators. When considering the more stringent class-A+ corresponding to a 12.5\% limit, one of the two considered options that rearranges the 300\textendash 1200\,nm spectral range into 6 bands appears to still assure the equivalence of the class A+ limits among considered instruments. The En performance index analysis highlights some inconsistencies with the estimated measurement uncertainty or instrument drifts from the expected performance, and the need of further improvements in calibration, set up and measurement procedures.},

This poses new challenges in the correct measurement of the spectral content of solar simulators and natural sunlight in those wavelength bands that lie outside these limits. This study proposes an extension of the IEC 60904-9 bandwidth by adding two bands in the UV (300-400 nm) and NIR (1100-1200 nm) regions. This new proposed extension is analysed in terms of spectral match, using spectral measurements of Global Normal Irradiance (GNI) acquired during the 6th European Spectroradiometer Intercomparison by eight independent laboratories. A laboratory is selected to provide reference spectra, and the spectral match of the other ones is calculated, both on a single-measurement level and on a daily average level. The intra-day and inter-day variations are evaluated as well. Results show that all investigated laboratories are capable to assure a spectral match well below the {$\pm$}25\% limit corresponding to class-A simulators. When the more stringent, informal class-A+ corresponding to the {$\pm$}12.5\% limit is considered, four out of seven laboratories are still compliant with it.},

  abstract = {Information-centric networking (ICN) has long been advocating for radical changes to the Internet, but the upgrade challenges that these entail have hindered its adoption. To break this loop, the POINT project proposed a hybrid, IP-over-ICN, architecture: IP networks are preserved at the edge, connected to each other over an ICN core. This exploits the key benefits of ICN, enabling individual network operators to improve the performance of their IP-based services, without changing the rest of the Internet. This paper first provides an overview of POINT and outlines how it can improve upon IP in terms of performance and resilience. It then describes a trial of the POINT prototype in a production network, where real users operated actual IP-based applications. As part of the trial, we carried out experiments to evaluate the quality of experience (QoE) for video services offered via either HLS or IPTV, using either IP or POINT as a substrate. The results from the trial verify that the IP-over-ICN approach of POINT offers enhanced QoE to the users of these video services, compared with traditional IP, especially under exceptional network conditions.},

  abstract = {This review investigates the potential of photovoltaics in southern Europe and Middle East/North Africa in terms of PV status and policies/initiatives for PV market development in the region. In some Sunbelt countries, PV has become a competitive alternative for electricity generation resulting from a combination of high solar resource, decreasing PV system costs and high fuel prices. The PV levelized cost of electricity has fallen in some regions to 0.08 V/kWh whilst retail electricity prices are almost three times higher in some cases attesting to the ideal conditions in the region for PV uptake. In grid parity regions of south Europe, incentives such as feed-in-tariffs have served their purpose. Net metering and self-consumption are proving to be good solutions for driving effectively the PV market as evidenced for the case of Cyprus. In MENA countries, the renewables policy landscape, although still at an exploratory phase, is rapidly developing providing the backbone for a large number of new PV projects. This reflects the region's commitment to meet its ambitious national targets regarding PV. Overall, the timing for the whole region is excellent to achieve energy sustainability, once better policies are adopted and challenges regarding grid integration and reliability are addressed.},

  abstract = {Energy yield measurement and radiation yield determination in the field of photovoltaics (PV) are subject to fast development regarding estimation uncertainties and error in prediction [1]. Both are determined mainly by constraints given by equipment development, calibration schemes and operation routines. Further, an increasing range of PV technologies is available on the market showing rather different spectral responsivities. These require precise PV device calibrations, either outdoor or indoor, with accurate measurement of the light-source. Under these boundary conditions accurate spectrally resolved solar irradiance measurements are gaining higher importance compared to recent years. Finally also PV energy yield estimations (predictions) may benefit from more accurate information on the solar spectrum. The International Spectroradiometer and Broadband intercomparison (ISRC) is evaluating measurement devices, measurement routine and equivalence in measurement results. Last year edition involved 9 scientific institutions and 5 commercial partners of 8 countries, testingmeasurement capabilities and best practices in spectrally resolved solar irradiance between 300 nm and 1700 nm. This work compares results and best practice approaches during the recent years of intercomparison. Capability of precision improvements in measurement as well as deviation in measurement approaches, instruments and institutes are highlighted. The analysis aims to conclude on effects of harmonization efforts, spreading of best-practice.},

Due to the dependence of such systems on the weather conditions the electricity injected into the grid is intermittent in nature with potentially negative impact on the grid operation. The quality and quantity of the electrical power produced from solar systems is directly related to the available solar irradiance and therefore any disturbances to the latter affect the produced power. In this paper, the characterisation and classification of the daily solar irradiance from 12 locations in mainland USA is presented based on 4 years of ground measurements. The K-POP method used evaluates the quantity and quality of solar irradiance for a day and as a consequence classifies the day based on these two indices. The statistical analysis of the results shows high correlation through the years for each station. This is a strong indication that the sky conditions are predictable and that with the utilisation of mechanisms, such as storage, spinning reserve, etc. solar systems can become a major contributor to the energy mix. Finally, this analysis provides better insight into the solar resource of a given location.},

  abstract = {Grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems have become a significant constituent of the power supply mix. A challenge faced by both users and suppliers of PV systems is that of defining and computing a reliable metric of annual degradation rate while in service. This paper defines a new measure to calculate the degradation rate of PV systems from the PV field measured performance ratio (PR). At first, the PR time series is processed by conventional principal component analysis, which yields seasonality as the dominant data feature. The environment, operating conditions, uncertainty, and hardware used for monitoring influence the outdoor measurements unpredictably. These influences are viewed as perturbations that render the dominant feature obtained by PCA unsuitable to be used in a degradation rate definition. Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is proposed to alleviate these effects. The new measure is defined as the area enclosed by the time series of the corrected by the RPCA annual monthly PR values. The degradation rates obtained for different technologies are compared with those obtained in previous studies. The results have shown that the degradation rates estimated by RPCA were in good agreement with previous investigations and provided increased confidence due to mitigation of uncertainty.},

The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the application of the different statistical methods to estimate the annual degradation rate is sensitive to the amount of missing data, since all the statistical methods underestimated the degradation rate consistently with the increasing level of missing data. In addition, the application of the Seasonal Decomposition (Seas) technique yielded robust annual degradation rate estimates since for a level of 40 \% of missing data, the absolute percentage error (APE) of the annual degradation rate estimated with all statistical techniques, was less than 7.5 \%.  Finally, Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD) was shown to be the most robust technique for estimating the degradation rate when imputation was applied, while Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was the most successful technique in providing robust degradation rate estimates when not applying any imputation.},

  abstract = {The outdoor assessment of photovoltaic (PV) systems provides useful data to validate performance modelling approaches. The scope of this work is to analyse and model the outdoor performance of different grid-connected poly-crystalline Silicon (poly-c Si) PV systems installed at the PV Technology Laboratory of the University of Cyprus (UCY). These systems provided by Hanwha Q CELLS were installed side-by-side at a fixed-plane and monitored for a period of one year. Apart from PV system operational data, meteorological data were also extracted. Specifically, the focus of this ongoing analysis is to compare the performance of different modelling methods against real outdoor energy measurements and to investigate the impact of using real meteorological data for the simulation using the PVWATTS model and the PVSYST simulation software. The annual DC Performance Ratio (PRDC) results using the PVWATTS model and calculated using the PVSYST software showed that the prediction error (PE) was below 2 \% for the PVSYST simulation, whereas for the PVWATTS model PE differences of up to 8 \% were observed when compared to the measured PRDC.},

  abstract = {With the current uptake and market penetration of different technology photovoltaics (PV), important questions arise regarding their lifetime power decline and degradation. Another important consideration is the influence of different climatic conditions on the exhibited degradation rates, with warmer operating conditions theoretically affecting module components to a higher extent compared to lower temperatures. The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of the annual performance loss rates of different photovoltaic (PV) systems, ranging from mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si) to multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si) and thin-film technologies, installed in Cyprus over a period of five years. The results of the performance loss rate investigation showed that the mono-c-Si and multi-c-Si systems exhibited average annual performance loss rates that were lower than the 1 \{\%\}/year stated by most PV module manufactures. Conversely, the average annual performance loss rate of the thin-film systems was -1.78 \{\%\}/year.},

  abstract = {Mathematical and empirical models have long been used to describe the output behaviour of photovoltaic (PV) systems. The purpose of this paper is to compare the combined uncertainties inherent in the results when using three of these models; the single-point efficiency, the single-point efficiency with temperature correction and the PVUSA model. This evaluation was performed using outdoor measurement data from 12 different grid- connected PV systems of 1 kWp each, operating in Cyprus since June 2006 along with measurement data from the meteorological sensor network on-site. The models showed a wide variation in combined uncertainties, demonstrating the dependence of accurate energy yield predictions on the model and sensing equipment. In particular, it was shown that the application of temperature correction on the single-point efficiency model using the manufacturer provided temperature coefficients (\$\textbackslash gamma\$MPP) resulted in a reduction of the combined uncertainty. In the case of the single-point efficiency model, the uncertainties were in the name-plate efficiency at standard test conditions (\$\textbackslash eta\$STC) and the global irradiation measured on the plane of array (GPOA), producing a combined uncertainty of {$\pm$}7\{\%\} on the annual dc energy yield of all PV systems. By applying temperature correction on the model, the combined uncertainties dropped to an average of {$\pm$}5.60\{\%\}, despite the introduction of additional uncertainties from \$\textbackslash gamma\$MPP and Tmodule. Lastly, the PVUSA model showed even lower combined uncertainties, in the realm of {$\pm$}1.60\{\%\}. The paper also presents the combined uncertainties inherent in the three models separately for four different years (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010).},

  abstract = {Monolithic multi-junction solar cells are becoming prevalent in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems due to their high demonstrated conversion efficiencies. However, these devices often operate at sub-optimal levels due to current mismatch losses arising between each p-n junction as a result of natural variation in the solar spectrum at the earth's surface. The use of quantum wells in solar cell design affords improved control over the spectral response of the cells via band-gap engineering. This makes it possible to tailor the spectral response of a cell for optimum performance under a given annual spectral resource. Establishing the optimum spectral response for a given location is a major challenge of this approach to cell design, and relies heavily on averaged and modelled data based on combinations of satellite and sparse ground measurements. In addition, there is only limited field experience of such technology to date. The purpose of this work is to investigate through experiment the effect of incorporating multi-quantum-well (MQW) structures into photovoltaic cells to respond to a specific range of annual irradiation spectra and to compare the results obtained with those predicted through modelling. A number of triple-junction cells of different design have been placed side-by-side on an accurate solar tracker, and current-voltage characteristics of each taken at regular intervals over a few months. The outputs are then compared to those predicted by a model of cell performance that includes simulated spectra, generated with the SMARTS program, specific to that location and period of time. Results obtained from outdoor testing indicate that the cells designed to provide improved current matching under the spectral conditions in which they have been tested have performed more consistently than conventional cell designs. This is evident when the short-circuit current is normalised to a fixed direct normal irradiation and temperature, and plotted against atmospheric depth. Detailed analysis of the spectral resource is expected to reveal additional information on the performance of the cells.},

  abstract = {In this work, outdoor and indoor measurements from a double junction amorphous Silicon (a-Si) photovoltaic (PV) module installed at the PV Technology outdoor test site of the University of Cyprus were used to assess the field performance from November 2012 to June 2015. The measurements consisted of continuous current- voltage (I-V) curves from outdoor testing and bi-weekly indoor ratings at standard test conditions (STC) in a solar simulator. In order to accurately evaluate the field performance under varying meteorological conditions, the electrical parameters were extracted from field I-V curves and were then filtered for high irradiance and low angles of incidence, extrapolated to 1000 W/m2 irradiance and corrected for temperature losses. Additionally, the outdoor I-V curves were used to calculate Loss Factor Model (LFM-B) parameters. A comparison of the indoor ratings at STC to each of the two field performance indicators has shown that there was very good agreement with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.9 \{\%\} and 4.47 \{\%\} when using the filtered and corrected PMPP and the LFM-B Performance Factor (PF), respectively. Lastly, the effects of the module's metastable behavior on the performance were analyzed from indoor measurements at STC. It has been shown that the module suffered a degradation rate of 2.36 \{\%\}/year, while the Staebler-Wronski effect and thermal annealing resulted in {$\pm$}3 \{\%\} variation of the performance, observable throughout the year.},

The results have shown that the RP of crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies was higher during winter. This was also the case for the coppereindium gallium-diselenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) technologies but with lower seasonal amplitude. The amorphous silicon (a-Si) technology exhibited a different seasonal profile, with high RP during summer and autumn and low during winter.

The methodology is based on the installation of a 1 kWp, grid- connected photovoltaic system and 2 additional modules of the same make/model on the POA, with the additional modules connected to a computer controlled dc load. The dc load will keep each module operating at MPP, while performing I-V scans at regular intervals. This serves two purposes: a) the modules are operating and degrading as if they were connected to an inverter that keeps them at full load conditions and b) the I-V scans allow for the periodic measurement of the electrical characteristics of the PV modules, all essential in the study of their degradation. The additional modules will be periodically dismounted from the POA and put on a testbed, to acquire the STC (Standard Test Conditions) rating and the dark I-V characteristics, according to the IEC 60904-1 standard. The grid-connected system will serve as the basis for PV performance evaluation and degradation rate determination from a system standpoint. The paper will present important issues arising when comparing the outdoor and indoor measurements. These are: 1) the spectrum utilization, 2) how the time between when a module is dismounted from the POA and tested under the solar simulator can affect the internal stability of the module, 3) the I-V scanning sweep rate and, 4) the duration of the light pulses of the solar simulator and how the measured Pmax, with mismatch factor (MMF) corrections as described in standard IEC 60904-7, compares to the outdoor measurements of the PV technologies.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturing have resulted in the production of highly efficient cells and modules and the significant reduction of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) due to the increased demand for the technology. Two key factors that will increase the demand and reduce the LCOE even further are: 1) improving operations and maintenance (O\&M) to ensure the optimal operation of deployed PV plants, and 2) accurately estimating the well-known effect of gradual performance degradation and guaranteeing their lifetime energy yield. Both of these key factors require active monitoring and supervision of the deployed PV plants, analysis of field measurement data for estimation of the long-term degradation rate, RD with statistical confidence and comparison with the warranty. This analysis will in turn enable the planning of actions to mitigate the causes of low performance and minimize the amount of energy lost. The accurate estimation of the RD for a deployed PV plant will also enable more accurate and precise lifetime energy yield forecasting and stricter performance guarantees, further reducing investment risk and increasing confidence in the technology. This work deals with developing a generalized data analysis methodology based on statistical principles, for estimating the energy degradation rate, using field measurement data from eleven different grid-connected PV plants operating side-by-side since June 2006 at the PV Technology test site of the University of Cyprus. The methodology was designed to provide accurate and robust un-supervised estimation with a measure of uncertainty. Also, it was designed for application on commercial PV plants, where sensor deployment is sparse and data logging capabilities are low due to cost. Therefore, the minimum requirements for the realization of the developed methodology are accurate measurements of power and an accurate measurement of irradiance. The methodology was developed to address four main issues in the field of PV degradation: 1) measurement qualification and creation of a clean data set from uncertain sources, 2) detection of suboptimal performance from the measurement data and assessment of the effect on the actual degradation rate, 3) analysis of time series of constructed performance metrics to extract and analyse the trend in either a linear or non-linear fashion, and 4) substitution of adhoc analyses and empirical parametrisation with formal statistical tests, to enable the applicability of the methodology in an unsupervised way. Therefore, a data pipeline consisting of measurement qualification, creation of performance metrics, detection and treatment of outliers and trend modelling procedures was developed. In addition, the computational expense of implementing such a methodology was explored and alternative ways were proposed to further reduce it. Extensive experimental work has also been performed in order to estimate the RD of the studied PV arrays, under standard test conditions (STC). These experiments were performed ex situ, using high quality laboratory equipment (i.e. flasher, electroluminescence (EL), infrared (IR) thermography), with traceable calibration throughout the evaluation period. Even though the results were more traceable and certain, indoor testing required a significant amount of manual labour and system downtime and introduced risk due to mounting/dismounting and transporting the PV modules to the laboratory. The PV modules under study were characterized in the laboratory and the results were used to benchmark the accuracy of the developed unsupervised methodology. In this way, PV performance measured under a broad spectrum of prevailing meteorological conditions was compared to the results of indoor testing under international standards. This was one of the most important outcomes of this work as this kind of long-term comparison on multiple, co-located PV technologies which were monitored and characterized in a research-grade environment was extremely rare in the bibliography.},

  abstract = {This paper details the development of the pvpaR (PV Performance Analysis in R) web application built on open-source technologies for the automated and user-friendly evaluation of photovoltaic (PV) system performance and identif cation and classification of faults. pvpaR's ecosystem is based on the R statistical computing project, both for the back-end as well as for the front-end which uses the Shiny web application framework. Currently, the core of the application incorporates models for synthesizing time-series of irradiance, module temperature, PV system voltage, current, DC and AC power. These are used to validate the imported field measurements and create the comparison which the fault identification function is dependent upon. The web application can currently import measurements from flat files and databases. It has been released under the GNU Affero GPL license to encourage contributions, with the goal to become a useful tool for the PV community and PV system owners.},

Fifteen-minute average measurements of the array power at the maximum power point, PA, were used to construct time series of the performance ratio, RP, of each array. The time series were analysed with regARIMA and classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) in order to extract the trend. Then, linear regression (LR) was used to calculate the slope. To validate the results, all arrays were disassembled and every module was tested at Standard Test Conditions (STC) in a class A+A+A+ solar simulator, in order to calculate the nominal array degradation rate. Comparison of both methods has shown good agreement between the time series analysis approach and the indoor testing approach, for PV arrays with no identified failures through electroluminescence (EL). On the contrary, for modules with identified failures through EL, the nominal array degradation rate was higher in comparison to the field PLR. Differences between the two methods have been shown to be due to cracked cells, hotspots and spectral response mismatch. Lastly, the comparison has shown that amongst the time series analysis methods, regARIMA produced statistically significant PLR with low uncertainty and the best agreement with the nominal array degradation rates.},

The arrays under study have been operating side-by-side since June 2006 in Nicosia, Cyprus. Fifteen-minute average field measurements over their first ten years of operation were used to create a data set, in which invalid measurements were removed and logged system downtimes were corrected based on past performance. The resulting data set was randomly sampled to select data points which were designated as Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) in order to create unbiased artificial outage periods. The same data set was treated with missing data imputation techniques such as imputation by the mean, linear interpolation and imputation by bootstrap. The resulting data sets were then analysed with linear regression (LR), classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) and regARIMA models to extract the trend and estimate the energy degradation rates. The results have shown that regARIMA was the most robust method for up to 10 \% of missing data, the LR and CSD methods were sensitive starting from 2 \% of missing data and that imputation by the bootstrap enhanced the accuracy of the estimated degradation rates up to 20 \% for regARIMA and 40 \% for LR.},

  abstract = {This dissertation presents the work done for improving the cascode analogue-to-digital converter by using switched-current techniques. Various current copier cells and their effects on the copied current were investigated. This included techniques for reducing the error caused by charge injection, large current inputs and low output resistance. The result of the investigation was that active current copier cells offered the best performance by solving the low output resistance problem and that capacitors added in parallel to the gate and source of the memory transistor solved the problem of large input currents. The converter was redesigned with active current copier cells which were used to replicate the operation of the original cascode ADC. The same technology with the original cascode ADC was used (Mietec 2.4{$\mu$}m). Simulations done in HSpice have shown that the converter is operating correctly and has decreased the conversion errors by more than 200\%, up to the last stage, when the current is fed into the current comparator. The comparator was kept the same as the original cascode ADC and could not be adapted for use in the new circuit. The error was reduced to less than half though, which proves that this type of converter has potential. The simulations have also shown that the switched-current ADC had a maximum power consumption of 1.45mW /bit, which is less than half the consumption of the original cascode ADC (3mW /bit).},

The statistical trend analysis methods include Linear Regression (LR), Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW) and LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) and were applied on monthly constructed time series of RP, calculated from the fifteen-minute average array DC power at the maximum power point, PA, of each grid-connected PV system. The comparison of the estimated performance loss rates for each technology showed that the average performance loss rate of the c-Si systems was 0.75 {$\pm$} 0.17 \{\%\}/year. On the other hand, the average performance loss rate for the thin-film systems was 1.95 {$\pm$} 0.11 \{\%\}/year for all methods, with a 95 \{\%\} confidence interval. The good agreement in the results between the different methods for each system also provided evidence that the performance loss rates have started to converge to a steady value. Finally, it was demonstrated that trend extraction techniques produced similar estimates between them and with very low uncertainty, even with less than five years of outdoor exposure, whereas LR was the least robust method for all technologies, since it was greatly affected by the seasonality and outliers of the time series and needed more years of data to produce reliable estimates.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a review of methodologies for measuring the degradation rate, RD, of photovoltaic (PV) technologies, as reported in the literature. As presented in this paper, each method yields different results with varying uncertainty depending on the measuring equipment, the data qualification and filtering criteria, the performance metric and the statistical method of estimation of the trend. This imposes the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true degradation rate and, subsequently, the effective lifetime of a PV module/array/system and proves the need for defining a standardized methodology. Through a literature search, four major statistical analysis methods were recognized for calculating degradation rates: (1) Linear Regression (LR), (2) Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), (3) AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and, (4) LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS), with LR being the most common. These analyses were applied on the following performance metrics: (1) electrical parameters from IV curves recorded under outdoor or simulated indoor conditions and corrected to STC, (2) regression models such as the Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications (PVUSA) and Sandia models, (3) normalized ratings such as Performance Ratio, RP, and PMPP/GI and, (4) scaled ratings such as PMPP/Pmax, PAC/Pmax and kWh/kWp. The degradation rate results have shown that the IV method produced the lowest RD and LR produced results with large variation and the largest uncertainty. The ARIMA and LOESS methods, albeit less popular, produced results with low variation and uncertainty and with good agreement between them. Most importantly, this review showed that the RD is not only technology and site dependent, but also methodology dependent.},

  abstract = {The efficient provision of IPTV services requires support for IP multicasting and IGMP snooping, limiting such services to single operator networks. Information-Centric Networking (ICN), with its native support for multicast seems ideal for such services, but it requires operators and users to overhaul their networks and applications. The POINT project has proposed a hybrid, IP-over-ICN, architecture, preserving IP devices and applications at the edge, but interconnecting them via an SDN-based ICN core. This allows individual operators to exploit the benefits of ICN, without expecting the rest of the Internet to change. In this paper, we first outline the POINT approach and show how it can handle multicast-based IPTV services in a more efficient and resilient manner than IP. We then describe a successful trial of the POINT prototype in a production network, where real users tested actual IPTV services over both IP and POINT under regular and exceptional conditions. Results from the trial show that the POINT prototype matched or improved upon the services offered via plain IP.},
