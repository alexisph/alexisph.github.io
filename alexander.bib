	abstract = {The power produced from solar systems depends strongly on the prevailing weather conditions and more precisely on solar irradiance. Due to the dependence of such systems on the weather conditions the electricity injected into the grid is intermittent in nature with potentially negative impact on the grid operation. The quality and quantity of the electrical power produced from solar systems is directly related to the available solar irradiance and therefore any disturbances to the latter affect the produced power. In this paper, the characterisation and classification of the daily solar irradiance from 12 locations in mainland USA is presented based on 4 years of ground measurements. The K-POP method used evaluates the quantity and quality of solar irradiance for a day and as a consequence classifies the day based on these two indices. The statistical analysis of the results shows high correlation through the years for each station. This is a strong indication that the sky conditions are predictable and that with the utilisation of mechanisms, such as storage, spinning reserve, etc. solar systems can become a major contributor to the energy mix. Finally, this analysis provides better insight into the solar resource of a given location.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a review of methodologies for measuring the degradation rate, RD, of photovoltaic (PV) technologies, as reported in the literature. As presented in this paper, each method yields different results with varying uncertainty depending on the measuring equipment, the data qualification and filtering criteria, the performance metric and the statistical method of estimation of the trend. This imposes the risk of overestimating or underestimating the true degradation rate and, subsequently, the effective lifetime of a PV module/array/system and proves the need for defining a standardized methodology. Through a literature search, four major statistical analysis methods were recognized for calculating degradation rates: (1) Linear Regression (LR), (2) Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), (3) AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and, (4) LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS), with LR being the most common. These analyses were applied on the following performance metrics: (1) electrical parameters from IV curves recorded under outdoor or simulated indoor conditions and corrected to STC, (2) regression models such as the Photovoltaics for Utility Scale Applications (PVUSA) and Sandia models, (3) normalized ratings such as Performance Ratio, RP, and PMPP/GI and, (4) scaled ratings such as PMPP/Pmax, PAC/Pmax and kWh/kWp. The degradation rate results have shown that the IV method produced the lowest RD and LR produced results with large variation and the largest uncertainty. The ARIMA and LOESS methods, albeit less popular, produced results with low variation and uncertainty and with good agreement between them. Most importantly, this review showed that the RD is not only technology and site dependent, but also methodology dependent.},

	abstract = {The effect of temperature on different grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) technologies installed in Cyprus was analyzed in this study. Initially, the performance losses due to the temperature effect on the annual energy yield of each technology were investigated using measurements of module temperature and the manufacturer provided maximum power point (MPP) temperature coefficients, gPMPP. The same methodology was also applied using outdoor evaluated gPMPP coefficients for comparison. When using the manufacturer's temperature coefficient, the results showed that over the evaluation period the highest average thermal losses in annual dc energy yield were 8\{\%\} for mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si) and 9\{\%\} for multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si) technologies while for thin-film technologies, the average losses were 5\{\%\}. Similar losses were found when using the outdoor evaluated temperature coefficients. Additionally, temperature effects on the seasonal performance of the different technologies were evident on the monthly average performance ratio (PR). For the amorphous silicon (a-Si) technologies, a performance increase from spring until early autumn was observed and was attributed to thermal annealing. The effect of thermal annealing on the performance was evident by filtering dc MPP power measurements at high irradiance (greater than 800 W/m2) and restricting the values at geometric air mass (AM) in the range 1 \{{\textbackslash}textless\}= geometric AM \{{\textbackslash}textless\}= 1.5. The extracted dc MPP power was corrected for irradiance and temperature at standard test conditions (STC) using the manufacturer provided gPMPP over a period of two years. Subsequently, the effect of thermal annealing was further investigated by extracting dc MPP power measurements at geometric AM in the range 1.4 \{{\textbackslash}textless\}= geometric AM \{{\textbackslash}textless\}= 1.6 in order to minimize the spectral influences on the performance of a-Si technologies. An increase in power for all the a-Si technologies was obvious during the warm summer season and was recorded over the period of March until September for both years.},

The classical seasonal decomposition (CSD) and X-12-ARIMA statistical techniques were applied on monthly DC performance ratio, RP, time series, constructed from field measurements over the systems' first five years of operation. The results have shown that the RP of crystalline silicon (c-Si) technologies was higher during winter. This was also the case for the coppereindium gallium-diselenide (CIGS) and cadmium telluride (CdTe) technologies but with lower seasonal amplitude. The amorphous silicon (a-Si) technology exhibited a different seasonal profile, with high RP during summer and autumn and low during winter. In addition, the trends extracted from the application of CSD and X-12-ARIMA on three-year, four-year and five-year RP time series were used to estimate linear performance loss rates. A comparison between standard linear regression (LR), CSD and X-12-ARIMA has shown that CSD and X-12-ARIMA resulted in higher rates overall for c-Si, 1.07 and 0.93\{\%\}/year respectively, but with significantly less uncertainty than LR. Lastly, it was shown that X-12-ARIMA provided statistical inference in the presence of outliers and produced model residuals that were uncorrelated, in contrast to CSD.},

	abstract = {Grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems have become a significant constituent of the power supply mix. A challenge faced by both users and suppliers of PV systems is that of defining and computing a reliable metric of annual degradation rate while in service. This paper defines a new measure to calculate the degradation rate of PV systems from the PV field measured performance ratio (PR). At first, the PR time series is processed by conventional principal component analysis, which yields seasonality as the dominant data feature. The environment, operating conditions, uncertainty, and hardware used for monitoring influence the outdoor measurements unpredictably. These influences are viewed as perturbations that render the dominant feature obtained by PCA unsuitable to be used in a degradation rate definition. Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is proposed to alleviate these effects. The new measure is defined as the area enclosed by the time series of the corrected by the RPCA annual monthly PR values. The degradation rates obtained for different technologies are compared with those obtained in previous studies. The results have shown that the degradation rates estimated by RPCA were in good agreement with previous investigations and provided increased confidence due to mitigation of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {In this work, the performance loss rates of eleven grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems of different technologies were evaluated by applying linear regression (LR) and trend extraction methods to Performance Ratio, RP, time series. In particular, model-based methods such as Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), Holt-Winters (HW) exponential smoothing and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), as well as non-parametric filtering methods such as LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) were used to extract the trend from monthly RP time series of the first five years of operation of each PV system. The results showed that applying LR on the time series produced the lowest performance loss rates for most systems, but with significant autocorrelations in the residuals, signifying statistical inaccuracy. The application of CSD and HW significantly reduced the residual autocorrelations as the seasonal component was extracted from the time series, resulting in comparable results for eight out of eleven PV systems, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.22 \{\%\} between the performance loss rates calculated from each method. Finally, the optimal use of multiplicative ARIMA resulted in Gaussian white noise (GWN) residuals and the most accurate statistical model of the RP time series. ARIMA produced higher performance loss rates than LR for all technologies, except the amorphous Silicon (a-Si) system. The LOESS non-parametric method produced directly comparable results to multiplicative ARIMA, with a MAPE of -2.04 \{\%\} between the performance loss rates calculated from each method, whereas LR, CSD and HW showed higher deviation from ARIMA, with MAPE of 25.14 \{\%\}, -13.71 \{\%\} and -6.39 \{\%\}, respectively.},

The comparison of the resulting degradation rates for each PV group (c-Si and thin-film) showed that the monthly PR-TC-STL method provided the lowest standard deviation and a mean degradation rate of 1.12 \{\%\}/year for the c-Si PV systems. On the other hand, the daily PR-TC-LLS method demonstrated the lowest standard deviation and an average degradation rate of 2.47 \{\%\}/year for the thin-film PV systems. Linear regression using LLS produced the lowest degradation rates overall, but when temperature correction was applied, the calculated degradation rates were increased by 0.4 \{\%\}/year. LLS also showed the lowest standard deviation for the thin-film PV systems, which was further reduced by applying temperature correction.},

The measurements consisted of continuous current- voltage (I-V) curves from outdoor testing and bi-weekly indoor ratings at standard test conditions (STC) in a solar simulator. In order to accurately evaluate the field performance under varying meteorological conditions, the electrical parameters were extracted from field I-V curves and were then filtered for high irradiance and low angles of incidence, extrapolated to 1000 W/m2 irradiance and corrected for temperature losses. Additionally, the outdoor I-V curves were used to calculate Loss Factor Model (LFM-B) parameters. A comparison of the indoor ratings at STC to each of the two field performance indicators has shown that there was very good agreement with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.9 \{\%\} and 4.47 \{\%\} when using the filtered and corrected PMPP and the LFM-B Performance Factor (PF), respectively. Lastly, the effects of the module's metastable behavior on the performance were analyzed from indoor measurements at STC. It has been shown that the module suffered a degradation rate of 2.36 \{\%\}/year, while the Staebler-Wronski effect and thermal annealing resulted in Â±3 \{\%\} variation of the performance, observable throughout the year.},

	abstract = {The scope of this paper is to present a methodology for evaluating the performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules installed outdoors on the plane of array (POA) and operating at maximum power point (MPP). The methodology is based on the installation of a 1 kWp, grid- connected photovoltaic system and 2 additional modules of the same make/model on the POA, with the additional modules connected to a computer controlled dc load. The dc load will keep each module operating at MPP, while performing I-V scans at regular intervals. This serves two purposes: a) the modules are operating and degrading as if they were connected to an inverter that keeps them at full load conditions and b) the I-V scans allow for the periodic measurement of the electrical characteristics of the PV modules, all essential in the study of their degradation. The additional modules will be periodically dismounted from the POA and put on a testbed, to acquire the STC (Standard Test Conditions) rating and the dark I-V characteristics, according to the IEC 60904-1 standard. The grid-connected system will serve as the basis for PV performance evaluation and degradation rate determination from a system standpoint. The paper will present important issues arising when comparing the outdoor and indoor measurements. These are: 1) the spectrum utilization, 2) how the time between when a module is dismounted from the POA and tested under the solar simulator can affect the internal stability of the module, 3) the I-V scanning sweep rate and, 4) the duration of the light pulses of the solar simulator and how the measured Pmax, with mismatch factor (MMF) corrections as described in standard IEC 60904-7, compares to the outdoor measurements of the PV technologies.},

	abstract = {The effect of temperature on a single-junction a-Si, grid-connected, photovoltaic (PV) system installed in Cyprus was analysed in this study. Initially, the energy yield losses due to temperature were investigated based on acquired measurements of module temperature and using the manufacturer's maximum power point (MPP) temperature coefficients, \${\textbackslash}gamma\$PMPP. The same thermal loss investigation was also carried out, using the experimentally evaluated \${\textbackslash}gamma\$PMPP coefficients for comparison. In the case of the manufacturer's \${\textbackslash}gamma\$PMPP, the results showed that the thermal losses in the annual dc energy yield were 3 - 4 \{\%\}. Similar thermal losses were found when using the experimentally evaluated \${\textbackslash}gamma\$PMPP. In addition, temperature effects on the seasonal performance were evident on the monthly average performance ratio (PR) values. An increase in performance from spring until early autumn was observed and was attributed to thermal annealing. The effect of thermal annealing on the performance was revealed by filtering dc MPP power measurements at high irradiance (greater than 800 W/m2) and restricting the values at geometric air mass (AM) in the range 1 â‰¤ geometric AM â‰¤ 1.5. The extracted dc MPP power was corrected for irradiance and temperature at standard test conditions (STC) using the manufacturer's \${\textbackslash}gamma\$PMPP for a period of two years. The effect of thermal annealing was further investigated by extracting dc MPP power measurements at geometric AM in the range 1.4 â‰¤ geometric AM â‰¤ 1.6 in order to minimize the spectral effects on the performance of the a-Si system. The results showed that thermal annealing caused a 7.5 \{\%\} increase in power from March to September 2008 and a 7 \{\%\} increase for the same period in 2009.},

The purpose of this paper is to compare the combined uncertainties inherent in the results when using three of these models; the single-point efficiency, the single-point efficiency with temperature correction and the PVUSA model. This evaluation was performed using outdoor measurement data from 12 different grid- connected PV systems of 1 kWp each, operating in Cyprus since June 2006 along with measurement data from the meteorological sensor network on-site. The models showed a wide variation in combined uncertainties, demonstrating the dependence of accurate energy yield predictions on the model and sensing equipment. In particular, it was shown that the application of temperature correction on the single-point efficiency model using the manufacturer provided temperature coefficients (\${\textbackslash}gamma\$MPP) resulted in a reduction of the combined uncertainty. In the case of the single-point efficiency model, the uncertainties were in the name-plate efficiency at standard test conditions (\${\textbackslash}eta\$STC) and the global irradiation measured on the plane of array (GPOA), producing a combined uncertainty of Â±7\{\%\} on the annual dc energy yield of all PV systems. By applying temperature correction on the model, the combined uncertainties dropped to an average of Â±5.60\{\%\}, despite the introduction of additional uncertainties from \${\textbackslash}gamma\$MPP and Tmodule. Lastly, the PVUSA model showed even lower combined uncertainties, in the realm of Â±1.60\{\%\}. The paper also presents the combined uncertainties inherent in the three models separately for four different years (2006-2007, 2007-2008, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010).},

Another important consideration is the influence of different climatic conditions on the exhibited degradation rates, with warmer operating conditions theoretically affecting module components to a higher extent compared to lower temperatures. The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of the annual performance loss rates of different photovoltaic (PV) systems, ranging from mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si) to multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si) and thin-film technologies, installed in Cyprus over a period of five years. The results of the performance loss rate investigation showed that the mono-c-Si and multi-c-Si systems exhibited average annual performance loss rates that were lower than the 1 \{\%\}/year stated by most PV module manufactures. Conversely, the average annual performance loss rate of the thin-film systems was -1.78 \{\%\}/year.},

The statistical trend analysis methods include Linear Regression (LR), Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD), Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (HW) and LOcally wEighted Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS) and were applied on monthly constructed time series of RP, calculated from the fifteen-minute average array DC power at the maximum power point, PA, of each grid-connected PV system. The comparison of the estimated performance loss rates for each technology showed that the average performance loss rate of the c-Si systems was 0.75 Â± 0.17 \{\%\}/year. On the other hand, the average performance loss rate for the thin-film systems was 1.95 Â± 0.11 \{\%\}/year for all methods, with a 95 \{\%\} confidence interval. The good agreement in the results between the different methods for each system also provided evidence that the performance loss rates have started to converge to a steady value. Finally, it was demonstrated that trend extraction techniques produced similar estimates between them and with very low uncertainty, even with less than five years of outdoor exposure, whereas LR was the least robust method for all technologies, since it was greatly affected by the seasonality and outliers of the time series and needed more years of data to produce reliable estimates.},

	abstract = {Monolithic multi-junction solar cells are becoming prevalent in concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) systems due to their high demonstrated conversion efficiencies. However, these devices often operate at sub-optimal levels due to current mismatch losses arising between each p-n junction as a result of natural variation in the solar spectrum at the earth's surface. The use of quantum wells in solar cell design affords improved control over the spectral response of the cells via band-gap engineering. This makes it possible to tailor the spectral response of a cell for optimum performance under a given annual spectral resource. Establishing the optimum spectral response for a given location is a major challenge of this approach to cell design, and relies heavily on averaged and modelled data based on combinations of satellite and sparse ground measurements. In addition, there is only limited field experience of such technology to date. The purpose of this work is to investigate through experiment the effect of incorporating multi-quantum-well (MQW) structures into photovoltaic cells to respond to a specific range of annual irradiation spectra and to compare the results obtained with those predicted through modelling. A number of triple-junction cells of different design have been placed side-by-side on an accurate solar tracker, and current-voltage characteristics of each taken at regular intervals over a few months. The outputs are then compared to those predicted by a model of cell performance that includes simulated spectra, generated with the SMARTS program, specific to that location and period of time. Results obtained from outdoor testing indicate that the cells designed to provide improved current matching under the spectral conditions in which they have been tested have performed more consistently than conventional cell designs. This is evident when the short-circuit current is normalised to a fixed direct normal irradiation and temperature, and plotted against atmospheric depth. Detailed analysis of the spectral resource is expected to reveal additional information on the performance of the cells.},

Fifteen-minute average field measurements over their first ten years of operation were used to create a data set, in which invalid measurements were removed and logged system downtimes were corrected based on past performance. The resulting data set was randomly sampled to select data points which were designated as Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) in order to create unbiased artificial outage periods. The same data set was treated with missing data imputation techniques such as imputation by the mean, linear interpolation and imputation by bootstrap.

The results have shown that regARIMA was the most robust method for up to 10 \% of missing data, the LR and CSD methods were sensitive starting from 2 \% of missing data and that imputation by the bootstrap enhanced the accuracy of the estimated degradation rates up to 20 \% for regARIMA and 40 \% for LR.},

Comparison of both methods has shown good agreement between the time series analysis approach and the indoor testing approach, for PV arrays with no identified failures through electroluminescence (EL). On the contrary, for modules with identified failures through EL, the nominal array degradation rate was higher in comparison to the field PLR. Differences between the two methods have been shown to be due to cracked cells, hotspots and spectral response mismatch. Lastly, the comparison has shown that amongst the time series analysis methods, regARIMA produced statistically significant PLR with low uncertainty and the best agreement with the nominal array degradation rates.},

In addition, the performance of different imputation techniques was assessed in order to develop an optimal methodology for treating missing data for degradation rate estimation studies. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that the application of the different statistical methods to estimate the annual degradation rate is sensitive to the amount of missing data, since all the statistical methods underestimated the degradation rate consistently with the increasing level of missing data. In addition, the application of the Seasonal Decomposition (Seas) technique yielded robust annual degradation rate estimates since for a level of 40 \% of missing data, the absolute percentage error (APE) of the annual degradation rate estimated with all statistical techniques, was less than 7.5 \%.  Finally, Classical Seasonal Decomposition (CSD) was shown to be the most robust technique for estimating the degradation rate when imputation was applied, while Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was the most successful technique in providing robust degradation rate estimates when not applying any imputation.},

	abstract = {Innovative photovoltaic technologies with spectral sensitivity exceeding the 400 to 1100 nm limits (as currently defined by the international standard IEC 60904-9) are nowadays available on the market. This poses new challenges in the correct measurement of the spectral content of solar simulators and natural sunlight in those wavelength bands that lie outside these limits. This study proposes an extension of the IEC 60904-9 bandwidth by adding two bands in the UV (300-400 nm) and NIR (1100-1200 nm) regions. This new proposed extension is analysed in terms of spectral match, using spectral measurements of Global Normal Irradiance (GNI) acquired during the 6th European Spectroradiometer Intercomparison by eight independent laboratories. A laboratory is selected to provide reference spectra, and the spectral match of the other ones is calculated, both on a single-measurement level and on a daily average level. The intra-day and inter-day variations are evaluated as well. Results show that all investigated laboratories are capable to assure a spectral match well below the Â±25\% limit corresponding to class-A simulators. When the more stringent, informal class-A+ corresponding to the Â±12.5\% limit is considered, four out of seven laboratories are still compliant with it.},
